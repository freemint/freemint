A list of the most annoying bugs in MiNT
========================================

Please don't report bugs listed in this file; send patches instead.

- AES randomly starts to hog all the available memory. NOTE: it is 
  likely, that it is an AES bug (but I wouldn't trust in it, until 
  we're sure).

- Time:
  The kernel doesn't know when to change from your standard timezone
  to the alternative timezone (aka DST) and vice versa.  If DST
  in your area of the world changes from DST to standard time, let's
  say at Oct 28, 3am., and your machine is running then, you either
  have to change the system timezone manually (e.g. by running
  tzinit) or you have to reboot (hope you run tzinit at system
  start-up).  If you change your system time from a date where
  DST applies to a date where it does not apply you also have
  to reboot or run tzinit.  This isn't really considered a bug.
  Actually some time-keeping daemon should keep track of that
  stuff and change the kernel timezone whenever appropriate.

- Virtual memory manager:
  The virtual memory manager (aka VM) doesn't work correctly.
  Consider it experimental and feel free to improve it.
