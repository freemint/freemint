Installation                                                      FreeMiNT

There are two types of FreeMiNT archives available, built after every
commit on GitHub. You can choose between a "ready-to-go" bootable, pre-
configured installation or a "per-cpu build". The pre-configured builds
are named 1-19-<number>, number is a build "ID code".
Beside FreeMiNT/XaAES with a suitable configuration, they also contain a
texteditor (QED) and a desktop (TeraDesk).

The "per-cpu builds" are named 1-19-CUR-<cpu type> and do not contain
configuration files, desktop or other non-FreeMiNT applications; they are
created for easy upgrading or testing the latest snapshot without touching
the current existing installation.


Requirements:

- Atari TOS computer, compatible or emulator with at least 4 MB RAM and
  4 - 10 MB space on harddisc.

- Optional (but recommended): NVDI or fVDI.
  NVDI used to required if you wanted to run TT/Falcon kernel or higher
  with memory protection but this is no longer the case.

  NVDI must always be placed before mint*.prg in the AUTO folder!


First installation:

1. Download the pre-configured bootable snapshot (1-19-<number>),
   according to your system architecture.
2. Unpack the archive to your drive C:/ (boot partition). You can also
   install FreeMiNT to any other bootable partition, but then you have to
   adapt all paths in files mint.cnf and xaaes.cnf according to this
   location before rebooting.
3. Verify that mint-*.prg is the last program in your AUTO folder
   (Desktop view/sorting option: unsorted).
   If you used any MiNT version before, please deactivate it (rename .prg
   to .prx in auto folder).
4. Reboot.
5. Edit the files "mint.cnf" and "xaaes.cnf" with a texteditor according
   to your needs.


Update FreeMiNT:

1. Download the latest version of the per-cpu builds (1-19-CUR-*),
   according to your system architecture.
2. Unpack the archive to your drive C:/ (boot partition).
3. Rename your old mint*.prg in AUTO folder to .prx.
4. Verify that the new mint-*.prg is the last program in AUTO folder.
   Special for "020-060" version: This archive contains kernels
   (mint*.prgs in AUTO folder) for all machines from 020-060 cpus,
   including AranyM. So please delete (or rename to .prx) the kernels that
   you don't need.
   Make sure that there is only one (active) mint*.prg in AUTO folder!
5. In case you have updated from the bootable snaphost: copy your current
   configuration files "mint.cnf" and "xaaes.cnf" to the new 1-19-cur and
   1-19-cur/xaaes directories, edit the paths if needed and reboot.

Have fun!
