Here is a small FAQ specially for FreeMiNT 1.15:
------------------------------------------------


Q: How I can use a global folder for SLB's under FreeMiNT?

A: The default path pointing to a folder which contains SLB 
   libraries must be specified in the environment as SLBPATH 
   variable. For example:
   
   SLBPATH=u:\usr\local\lib\slb
   
   If one wants the previous behaviour, just undefine the 
   variable.

   Limits: SLBPATH value can be only specified as a GEMDOS-like (not 
           Unix-like) pathname. Hence such forms of the SLBPATH as:
           
           SLBPATH=c:\multitos\slb
           SLBPATH=u:\c\multitos\slb
           SLBPATH=u:\usr\local\lib\slb
           
           or
           
           SLBPATH=u:/usr/local/lib/slb
           
           are perfecly valid (provided these folders really do exist).


Q: I don't need VFAT. Why is the NEWFATFS integrated
   in the kernel?

A: The NEWFATFS is mainly a FAT filesystem. VFAT extension
   is optional. Main advantage of the FAT filesystem
   is the speed. Also you can use TOS & DOS partitions
   of any size. And large FAT32 partitions are supported
   (FAT32 allows small clusters on large partitions).
   It can also be fixed and supported easily.


Q: I heard I must install MinixFS 0.70 for new 1.15?

A: No, you can use every MinixFS version you like.
   It's recommended to use MinixFS 0.70.
   Advantage is that MinixFS 0.70 use new global
   cache-management, inconvenient is that mount/unmount
   support is done (never worked reliable, wrong implementation).


Q: MinixFS 0.70 doesn't recognize my MinixFS partitions
   anymore. I use AHDI as harddiskdriver.

A: MinixFS 0.70 need XHDI for partitions larger than
   32 MB. It's recommended to use a XHDI compliant
   harddiskdriver.


Q: If I delete/copy/move a lot of interleaved folders
   I get the error message:
   "block_IO.c: bio_unit_get: no free unit in cache, abort".

A: Your default cache is too small, increase cache size with
   the line "CACHE=<size in kb>" in your MiNT configuration
   file (with size >= 200 kb).


Q: I have a FAT32 formatted harddisk and it doesn't work
   under FreeMiNT 1.15. But I read FAT32 are supported?

A: Yes, FAT32 is supported. But you need at least
   HDDriver 7.55.


Q: Why do I need at least HDDriver 7.55 for FAT32 support?

A: Other harddisk drivers and older versions of HDDriver
   ignore FAT32 partitions completly. Only patch is to
   distribute our own harddisk driver or to update your
   driver. Or write an e-mail to the author of the harddisk
   driver and ask him to patch his driver, but the only
   supported driver at the moment is HDDriver.


Q: Can I use AHDI from ATARI corp. as harddisk driver?

A: Yes, this is possible. But it's strictly recommended
   to use a modern driver with XHDI interface.
   If you are going to access DOS partitions this is a must.
   It's not possible with AHDI to read/write DOS
   partitions.
   And also MinixFS 0.70 will no longer support large
   partitions under AHDI.
