Installation is simple:

- copy the right MiNT kernel to your auto folder
- remove a older MiNT version from your auto folder
- to disable memory protection rename it to mintnp.prg

Note 1: if you want to start it with memory protection, rename it to 
        mint.prg

Note 2: The 1.15.12 kernel release follow the traditional
        naming scheme and does NOT include the boot menu
        like in previous beta versions.

mint000.prx - 68000 kernel for the ST serie and Emulators
mint030.prx - 68030 kernel for all 030 ATARIs
mint040.prx - 68040/68060 kernel for all 040/060 ATARIs except Milan
mintmil.prx - 68040 kernel for the Milan
mintnp.prx  - 68030 debug kernel with debugging code
              (Note: the debugging code slows down this kernel)

Installation tips:

- NVDI must always be started before MiNT.

- WDIALOG must always be started after MiNT, best after starting the 
  AES. WDIALOG is also a very dirty hack, doesn't work correctly 
  under memory protection (to set the flags to global doesn't help 
  very much).
  
  It's recommended to skip Wdialog if it's possible. Under N.AES
  you can use N.DIALOG as clean Wdialog replacement. It's part
  of the N.AES distribution.

- Freedom is also a very dirty program. You get a lot of problems with
  Freedom installed. Your system will be unstable.
  
  It's strongly recommended not to use Freedom under MiNT!
