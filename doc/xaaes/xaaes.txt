1  Preface
**********

Parts of this document have been copied from the sample xaaes.cnf, the
old usrguide, and the xaaes-sources.

As not everything is clear, some items have been marked with ?.

Currently there is a lot  stuff  missing  in  this  documentation  but
things  that  are new to the user since version 0.998 should be mostly
there.

You may find additional information here:

2  Installation
***************

XaAES is normally included in the standard FreeMiNT distribution. It's
files  are  located  in  the subdirectory xaaes in the FreeMiNT system
folder. To start XaAES you need to run the program xaloader.prg  which
you  can  find  in  the  XaAES  folder. There are three common ways of
starting XaAES.

<sysdir> defaults  to   "<bootdrive>/mint/<VERSION>"   or,   if   this
directory  doesn't exist, "<bootdrive>/mint". <VERSION> is the version
of the kernel where dots are replaced  by  minus,  e.g.  1.17.0  gives
1-17-0.

 From mint.cnf The  keyword  GEM points to xaloader.prg. FreeMiNT will
     now start XaAES automatically. Example:

     GEM=<sysdir>\xaaes\xaloader.prg

 By init

 From the command line In this case you may quit XaAES with Alt-Q from
     the taskmanager to return to the commandline.

 By the TOS desktop Sometimes quitting XaAES also works here.

Xaloader runs <sysdir>/xaaes/xaaes.km by default.

You may specify any km-file on the commandline, e.g.:

     xaloader.prg [optional directory/]some.km



2.1  Files
==========

On startup XaAES needs the following files:


2.1.1  Resource-Files
---------------------

There are  3  mandatory  resource-files  located in the xaaes-startup-
directory:

 xaaes[n].rsc - standard resource-file, n: resource-version, currently
     009.

 xaaeswdg.rsc - special resource-file for widgets

 xa_xtobj.rsc - resource containing the extended AES object icons

You can  choose other resource-files for the first two in xaaes.cnf to
get different widgets for example (some are in the 'widgets'-folder).

The system-resource-file has a version-number (currently 0.0.9), which
gives  xaaes009.rsc.  If  this  file  is not found the name defined in
xaaes.cnf is used if present. If not, xaaes.rsc is used.

There is also a resource-file for  monochrome  display  (xa_mono.rsc),
that  reportedly saves memory, but it has not yet been updated for the
latest XaAES-version.

There are alternatives to xa_xtobj.rsc in the directory xobj.


2.1.2  Img-Files
----------------

XaAES also reads img-files from a folder called img. This is needed if
you  want  a  textured  look.  If  not  present,  you  get the default
rendering.


2.1.3  Mouse-Driver
-------------------

 moose.adi

 moose_w.adi

For mouse-control one of moose.adi or moose_w.adi  is  needed  in  the
xaaes-folder.  The  _w-version  is needed for mouse-wheel-support, but
also works if there is no wheel-mouse.

     Note: If there are both present moose_w.adi is used.


2.1.4  Help-File
----------------

If a file named xa_help.txt is found its content is displayed  in  the
About-window.


2.1.5  Config-Files
-------------------

 xaaes.cnf

This contains the configuration for XaAES. See below.



3  xaaes.cnf
************

This lets  you  set  several runtime-options for XaAES and its clients
and start programs at start-up. It uses mostly the same syntax  as  is
used in mint.cnf.

Commands are not case sensitive unless otherwise mentioned.

If a command isn't understood, it gets ignored.


3.1  Global Commands
====================

Default values  are false for bool, 0 for numbers or empty for strings
unless otherwise mentioned.

 LAUNCHPATH <character-sequence>

     Define the initial directory that is opened by the XaAES-launcher
     to  start  programs. A pattern to select typical executable files
     may be appended.

     Example: launchpath = u:\usr\gem\|*.prg|*.app|!*.*|*.acc

     See also: XaAES-Pattern-Matching

 CLIPBOARD <character-sequence> (default c:\clipbrd) Set    the    GEM
     clipboard to be in <directory>

 SNAPSHOT <character-sequence> define snapshot-program The    external
     snapshot is called with the arguments: '0 T 1 [x y w h]' where

     T=0: full screen, T=2: top window

     If x, y, w, h are provided, this rectangle should be snapped.  If
     XaAESSnap  is not loaded, the external program that is defined in
     xaaes.cnf for snapshots is called, if present.

 ACCPATH <character-sequence> Set the location that XaAES will try  to
     load  accessories  from (default is c:\). When ACCPATH is present
     in the Environment this precedes the config-variable.

 RESOURCE <character-
     sequence> main resource filename (default xaaes009.rsc) See
     Resource-Files

 WIDGETS <character-
     sequence> widgets resource filename (default xaaeswdg.rsc)

 USEHOME <bool> use $HOME in shell_find

 NAES_COOKIE <bool> fake nAES cookie

 MENUPOP_PIDS <bool> Setting menupop_pids = true makes XaAES list  its
     clients in the client-list- menupopup using the following format;

     " PPID(RPPID) -> PID Client nice name"

     where 'PPID'  is  the physical parent-pid of the Client (which is
     the AESSYS). 'RPPID' is the Process ID of the process that called
     shel_write()  to  start it, it is the "Real Parent PID". 'PID' is
     the Process ID of the client. If set to 'no' (the default),  only
     the  client's nice name (when available, else its 'proc_name') is
     listed.

 LRMB_SWAP <bool> Swap  left  and   right   mouse   buttons.   Setting
     'lrmb_swap  = true' will make XaAES swap the left and right mouse
     buttons.

 WIDGET_AUTO_HIGHLIGHT <bool> When widget_auto_highlight is set  true,
     standard  window  widget are automatically highlighted when mouse
     hovers over them. This is still very  experimental,  and  widgets
     are  not  actually  highlighted, they are just animated - that is
     redrawn in SELECTED status.

 REMAP_CICONS <bool> Use the palette defined in the resource to  remap
     icons.

 SET_RSC_PALETTE <bool> Use  the  palette  defined  in the resource as
     screen-palette.

 ALERT_WINDOWS <bitmask> default 0xffff alert_window  is   a   bitmask
     indicating  which  alerts coming via the alert pipe will be shown
     in a window. The idea is that this mask is used to tell  the  AES
     which alerts you want like this; bit 0 set -> show alerts with no
     icon bit 1 set -> show alerts with INFO icon bit 2  set  ->  show
     alerts with QUESTION icon bit 3 set -> show alerts with STOP icon
     etc., etc.

     Because there is no consideration as to which icon is  used  (for
     example, kernel's PROCESS KILLED alerts have icon #1, the same as
     used for other warnings/informative ALERTS), the implemention  is
     not complete. So for now use this to either turn off or on alerts
     altogether. To turn on alert windows, use a mask where  all  bits
     are set, y0xffff, and to turn off clear all bits, 0x0000

     THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT DEFINATE AND ONLY PARTIAL AS OF NOW

 FONT_ID <number> (default 1) Standard GDOS fontid for windows & stuff

 STANDARD_POINT <number> (default 10) Size  of the 'standard' AES font
     (for window titles, etc), high resolution

 MEDIUM_POINT <number> (default 9) Size of  the  'standard'  AES  font
     (for window titles, etc), low resolution

 SMALL_POINT <number> (default 8) Size of the 'small' AES font.

 POPSCROLL <number> (default 0) Set  number  of lines of a popup above
     which it will be made scrollable

 DC_TIME <number/ms> (default 50) double click time (ms)

 MP_TIMEGAP <number/ms> (default 3) Mouse packet time-gap. This is the
     time (in 200hz timer ticks) that must pass after a button-release
     event before a new button-press event is accepted  by  moose.adi.
     Because  of  unstable  mouse-buttons,  a  button-press may follow
     immediately after a button-release, creating  an  "extra"  mouse-
     click.  This  is  especially  annoying  when releasing the right-
     button  after  a  drag-session  (Thing's  directory-window,   for
     example), and the "extra-click" fires some unwanted action.

 VIDEO <number> (default 1) See Video-Modes

 REDRAW_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default 500) This is the time in ms XaAES
     will wait for  clients  to  service  WM_REDRAW  messages  between
     actions  that  generate redraws, like moving/closing/opening/etc.
     windows. If a client is busy and this 'timeout'  happens,  it  is
     marked as lagging and XaAES will service the redraws for it. When
     this happens, XaAES just draws the areas not serviced  with  dark
     gray  color  until  the  client  re-enters evnt_multi(). For slow
     machines, this timeout must be higher  (longer)  than  on  faster
     machines.

 POPUP_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default = 10) Time  in milliseconds before
     popups open.

 POPOUT_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default 1000) Time in milliseconds before
     popups close.

 SETENV same as for mint.cnf

 NEXT_ACTIVE <'client' or 'window'> (default 'window') Selects  wether
     the previous active application or  the  owner  of  the  previous
     topped  (or  only)  window  should  be  set  active  upon  client
     termination.

 CLOSE_LASTWIND <'client' or 'window'> (default 'window') DEPRECIATED
     - OBSOLETE close_lastwind =  'client'  or  'window'  (default  is
     'window')

     Selects what to do when the last window of a client is closed.

     Setting to  'client'  will keep the application whose last window
     is closed as  the  top  application.  This  prevents  XaAES  from
     putting  infront  another application when the last window of the
     application currently infront is closed.

     Setting to 'window' will make XaAES put the application who  owns
     the foremost window infront, making it active. This is the normal
     behaviour done by other AES's we thinks.

 APP_OPTIONS <string> See Commands for XaAES-clients.

 CANCEL <comma-separated string-list> List   of   words   that   XaAES
     interpretes  as Cancel. A button containing a word from this list
     in a dialog or alert will be selected if Undo is pressed.

 FILTERS <comma-separated string-list> List of patterns that  will  be
     contained  in  the  filter-menu  of  the  fileselector. See also:
     XaAES-Pattern-Matching.

 CTLALTA_SURVIVORS <comma-separated string-list> The strings  are  the
     filename  part  of  the program file, padded with spaces to fit 8
     characters. This is NOT the 'nice'  name.  So,  if  your  Toswin2
     binary  is  named  "tw2.app",  you  use  "tw2 ". Each app-name is
     separated with comma.  This  will  allow  you  to  specify  which
     applications  XaAES  does  not  attempt  to  terminate  when user
     presses CTRL-ALT-A  to  quit  all  applications.  Normally,  this
     keycombo  quits  all  running  applications  leaving  only XaAES.
     However, most of the time, keeping certain  applications  running
     is  preferred,  such  as  the  desktop,  the  taskbar,  av-server
     application, etc, etc. One special name is  '_aes_shell_',  which
     will prevent XaAES from terminating the desktop loaded via "shell
     = " configuration variable. One can still use  the  name  of  the
     desktop  program  if  it  is  konwn,  but an easier way is to use
     '_aes_shell_', as that will work  without  further  configuration
     modifications  when  one  changes  desktop  from,  say,  Thing to
     Jinnee. If  you  want  to  bypass  this  setting,  and  quit  ALL
     applications, leaving only XaAES, you can press ctrl-alt-shift-a.

     The following  will keep the desktop, taskbar and toswin2 running
     after a ctrl-alt-a action:

                          cltalta_survivors = "_aes_shell_", "taskbar ", "toswin2 "


     Applications that do not act on AP_TERM will also survive.

 KILL_WO_QUESTION <comma-separated string-list> Applications found  in
     this  list  will  be killed immediately during shutdown. The same
     rule as for CTLALTA_SURVIVORS applies to the strings

 ?MENU <'pull', 'push', 'leave', or 'nolocking'> (default 'leave')
     Determines whether a menu opens by hovering or clicking.  If  set
     to  push  menus  have  to be clicked to open. pull is the same as
     leave, nolocking has no effect.

 ?HELPSERVER <comma-separated string-list> List  of  apps  to  display
     help.

 VERTICAL_WHEEL_ID See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 HORIZONTAL_WHEEL_ID See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 VERTICAL_WHEEL_AMOUNT See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 HORIZONTAL_WHEEL_AMOUNT See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 ICNFY_... See Iconifying

 GRADIENTS <number> (default 0) setting  gradients  to a nonzero value
     turns on use of color gradients in  the  window  widget  and  aes
     object  renderer  in  hc/tc color modes. This is only a temporary
     configuration that will be gone later on. Only turn  this  on  if
     you have a fast machine.

 SHELL <string> Names the desktop-program

 RUN <string> Runs a program at startup. <string> is full-path\program


3.2  Commands for XaAES-clients
===============================

These may also affect XaAES itself.

The syntax is:

     <app_option>: app_options = <app-name>, <options-list>
     
     <options-list>: <options-list>, <option>
     
     <option>: <option-name> = <value>


For option-name see below. Value may be a number or true/false.


3.2.1  Client-options
---------------------

 windowner

 nohide

 xa_nohide

 xa_nomove

 xa_objced

 xa_none

 noleft

 thinwork

 nolive

 wheel_reverse

 naesff

 naes12

 naes

 winframe_size

 inhibit_hide

 spaceXinsert <bool> (default false) exchanges  space/insert-behaviour
     in dialogs and lists. If false, Insert will select a button in  a
     dialog,  space  will select a list. This option is casesensitive,
     so for example SPACEXINSERT will not be recognized.

 clwtna

 alt_shortcuts <number> (default 3)

        . 0: no shortcuts

        . 1: shortcuts for alerts

        . 2: shortcuts for dialogs

        . 3: shortcuts for dialogs and alerts

     Controls how XaAES handles  Alt-shortcuts.  Since  version  0.999
     every  standard  GEM-application  gets  Alt-shortcuts for dialogs
     that use form_do, even when there are no shortcuts  defined  with
     WHITEBAK in the resource-file.

     The shortcuts  that are defined in the clients' resource-file are
     always there.



4  Ctrl-Alt-Shortcuts
*********************

By pressing certain letters together with  Ctrl+Alt,  you  can  access
some more or less often used functions listed below.

   . A:  Terminates  all  applications  (A  list  of exceptions can be
     specified)

   . B: open System-window

   . E: open windows-submenu

   . F,L: open task-manager

   . I: (un-)iconify current top-window

   . K: launch a program

   . Help: open about

   . T,Home: Redraw screen

   . D: Open the screenshot dialog - see snapshot config-option

   . P: Restore palette in colour depth of 8-bits or less

   . Q: Quit XaAES (deactivated - set HOTKEYQUIT in xa_defs.c 1 to use
     this)

   . R: Attempt to recover a system that has locked up

   . V: Unhide all applications

   . W: Global window cycling

   . X. Hide all except the currently focused application

   . Y: Hide currently focused application

   . space: Open main menu bar

   . Shift-space: Open menu in current window if it has one, else open
     main menubar

   . TAB: Cycle open applications

   . Cursor-right: full current window



5  XaAES Main-menu
******************


5.1  About
==========

Instead of listing lots of contributors to XaAES and part of  the  GPL
in  previous  versions,  the  main  web-address for MiNT, and the GPL-
copyright are mentioned.

Additionally the file 'xa_help.txt' is displayed if present.

This file may contain some special tags:

   . Italic:

                  <i> <text> </i>


   . Bold:

                  <b> <text> </b>


   . Underlined:

                  <u> <text> </u>


If a <-bracket is preceeded by backslash,  is  gets  printed  and  not
interpreted.


5.2  The Launcher
=================

There is  no  desktop  needed  to  launch programs as XaAES is able to
start them itself using the Launcher. It  opens  the  fileselector  in
LAUNCHPATH.  You  may  also  select  any other directory from where to
start a program.

If a client is launched from launchpath, and the entry is  a  symlink,
home_path  for that client is set to the directory of the link-target.
It behaves then as if started  from  that  directory,  and  finds  its
resource- and other files.


5.3  System-Window
==================

In addition to the features described in

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.2.2

the following has been added:

   . Alerts have a timestamp and no '|' inside

   . "Environment"-Entries are sorted by name

   . New list-entry "System"

        - Screen-layout (resolution, bit-depth, pixel-format)

        - display CPU-info from /kern/cpuinfo

        - info about memory-protection

        - Kernel-version from /kern/version


5.4  Taskmanager
================

In addition to the features described in

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.4

the following has been added:

 List List is a tree, whereas clients are parent and their windows the
     children

 Select window or client If exited with Ok, and a client is  selected,
     this  client  is  topped. If a window is selected, this window is
     topped. Unselect with Space (or Insert).

 Pocesses Also lists non-AES-apps (not toppable, of course)

 Memory Displays memory-statistics found in /kern/meminfo

 Stop/Continue Similar to killing a process by clicking on  the  skull
     it may be stopped by clicking on the bed (the left one). Continue
     a stopped process by clicking on the right bed (the one with  the
     alarm)

 Load Display      actual      load      and     load-average     (see
     /doc/programmer/newcall.html/suptime.html).  By   selecting   the
     "toggle load"-button this can be switched off and on.

 Process-Information Displays more process-information in a table:

      ppid Process-ID of a processes parent

      pgrp The program-group of a process

      DOM Domain where 'M' is MiNT-domain, 'T' is TOS-domain.

      STATE where

           Cur: Current process

           Run: Process is running

           Wait: Process is waiting

           IO: Process is waiting for IO

           Zomb: Zombie

           TSR: Terminated and resident

           STOP: Stopped

           Slct: Waiting in Fselect

          For more details refer to programmer/mint.txt

 SZ Size. This is the total amount of memory the process uses.

 CPU Total count of 5ms-Ticks of CPU-usage of the process.

 % Percentage of the above. Note that this will not sum up to 100 most
     of the time because terminated processes do  not  appear  in  the
     list.

 args The commandline minus process-name.

The display of the taskmanager is updated on every open, or, when it's
open, by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F or Ctrl-Alt-L.



6  Environment
**************

XaAES uses the following environment-variables:

 ACCPATH See Global Commands.

 TOSRUN Define application for running text-mode programs.

 HOME See USEHOME

 PATH Used in shel_find for locating applications.



7  Fileselector
***************

Only changes from version 0.998 to 0.999 will be described here. For a
documentaion of the fileselector currently

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.3

is recommended.

The changes are mainly:


7.1  Keyboard
=============

   . PageUp/Down(Shift-CU/CD) pages the filelist.

   . The menu is opened by Ctrl-o.

   . If  an  entry  is selected in the list-box, Cursor-Right focusses
     the edit-field, so the selection can be edited.

   . By pressing Ctrl-C the path and  the  marked  file  (if  any)  is
     copied to the Clipboard.


7.2  File-Listing and Matching
==============================

   . Sorting  is  case-sensitive,  i.e.  Z is placed before a (like ls
     does on many systems).

   . File-Pattern is case-sensitive except the filesystem is uppercase
     (like  FAT)  or  the  caller runs in TOS-domain. See also: XaAES-
     Pattern-Matching.

   . If the fileselector finds a match  while  typing  that  match  is
     returned to the caller on OK (Return).



8  XaAES-Pattern-Matching
*************************

XaAES supports the following meta-characters for pattern-matching:

   . any character: '?'

   . any count of any character: '*'

   . character-class: '['<characters>']'

   . invert match: '!'

   . concatenate patterns: '|' between patterns

   . case-insensitivity of pattern: '|' first character

Matching *[],   *!,  *![],  !<whole  pattern>  is  possible.  Patterns
concatenated with | will result in any pattern  to  be  tested  for  a
match. This allows for example

     launchpath=<somepath>\*.prg|*.app|*.tos|*.ttp|*.acc|!*.*


to filter for extensions typical for executable files.

If '|'  is  the  first  character  the  whole  pattern-list is handled
caseinsensitive.

11.1  Features for XaAES-internal windows
=========================================

   . By pressing Ctrl-C the  selected  list-entry  is  copied  to  the
     Clipboard.

   . All XaAES-windows are resizable.

   . Keyboardnavigation in all lists:

        - List is selected

             * Cursor-right: open tree

             * Cursor-left: collapse

             * Cursor up/down: move the cursor

        - List is not selected

             * Cursor-right: scroll right

             * Cursor-left: scroll left

             * Cursor up/down: scroll up/down


11.2  Single-Task Mode
======================

This has  been  introduced  to  be  able  to run some old but valuable
software that did not work with MiNT since  version  1.16  (and  maybe
earlier), especially the pure-debugger.

This implies:

   . Stop all AES-Clients.

   . Call  ikbd_scan  in the kernel directly not via addroottimeout in
     case the single-task-client disabled the timer-interrupt.

   . No main-menu of any other app is activated.

To control this currently there has to be the bit 16 (0x10000) set  in
p_flags of the relevant binary.

Any client  that  has bit 17 (0x20000) set, is not stopped except when
the single-task-app has this bit also set, i.e. when it  has  0x3xxxx.
This  may  be  important  because the single-task-client possibly does
tty-IO, and needs the toswin (or another) console.

To setup an application for this run

     flags  <app>


and remember the value displayed.

Then run

     flags -f 0x1xxxx <app>.


where the 'x' are the previously displayed values.

If a program shall not be stopped do the same but with

     flags -f 0x2xxxx <app>


on that program-file.
