**********

Parts of this document have been copied from the sample xaaes.cnf, the
old usrguide, the wiki (http://wiki.sparemint.org/index.php/XaAES) and
the xaaes-sources.

As not everything is clear, some items have been marked with ?.

Currently there  is  a  lot  stuff  missing  in this documentation but
things that are new to the user since version 0.998 should  be  mostly
there.



2  Installation
***************

See also the XaAES-wiki

XaAES is normally included in the standard FreeMiNT distribution. It's
files are located in the subdirectory xaaes  in  the  FreeMiNT  system
folder.  To start XaAES you need to run the program xaloader.prg which
you can find in the XaAES folder.  There  are  three  common  ways  of
starting XaAES.

 From mint.cnf The  keyword  GEM points to xaloader.prg. FreeMiNT will
     now start XaAES automatically. Example:

     GEM=c:\mint\1-17-cur\xaaes\xaloader.prg

 By init

 From the command line In this case you may quit XaAES with Alt-Q from
     the taskmanager to return to the commandline.

 By the TOS desktop Sometimes quitting XaAES also works here.

Xaloader runs  <sysdir>/xaaes/xaaes.km  by  default, where <sysdir> is
the directory where MiNT finds its files, normally c:\mint\1-17-cur.

You may specify any km-file on the commandline, e.g.:

xaloader.prg [optional directory/]some.km


2.1  Files
==========

On startup XaAES needs the following files:


2.1.1  Resource-Files
---------------------

There are 3 mandatory resource-files  located  in  the  xaaes-startup-
directory:

 xaaes[n].rsc - standard resource-file, n: resource-version, currently
     009.

 xaaeswdg.rsc - special resource-file for widgets

 xa_xtobj.rsc - resource containing the extended AES object icons

You can choose other resource-files for the first two in xaaes.cnf  to
get different widgets for example (some are in the 'widgets'-folder).

There is  also  a  resource-file for monochrome display (xa_mono.rsc),
that reportedly saves memory, but it has not yet been updated for  the
latest XaAES-version.


2.1.2  Img-Files
----------------

XaAES also reads img-files from a folder called img. This is needed if
you want a  textured  look.  If  not  present,  you  get  the  default
rendering.


2.1.3  Mouse-Driver
-------------------

 moose.adi

 moose_w.adi

For mouse-control  one  of  moose.adi  or moose_w.adi is needed in the
xaaes-folder. The _w-version is needed  for  mouse-wheel-support,  but
also works if there is no wheel-mouse.

     Note: If there are both present moose_w.adi is used.


2.1.4  Help-File
----------------

If a  file  named xa_help.txt is found its content is displayed in the
About-window.


2.1.5  Config-Files
-------------------

 xaaes.cnf

This contains the configuration for XaAES. See below.



3  xaaes.cnf
************

This lets you set several runtime-options for XaAES  and  its  clients
and  start  programs at start-up. It uses mostly the same syntax as is
used in mint.cnf.

Commands are not case sensitive unless otherwise mentioned.

If a command isn't understood, it gets ignored.


3.1  Global Commands
====================

Default values are false for bool, 0 for numbers or empty for  strings
unless otherwise mentioned.

 LAUNCHPATH <character-sequence> Define   directory   from  where  the
     XaAES-launcher starts  programs.  A  pattern  to  select  typical
     executable files may be appended.

     Example: launchpath = u:\usr\gem\|*.prg|*.app|!*.*|*.acc

     See also: XaAES-Pattern-Matching

 CLIPBOARD <character-sequence> (default c:\clipbrd) Set    the    GEM
     clipboard to be in <directory>

 SNAPSHOT <character-sequence> define snapshot-program The    external
     snapshot is called with the arguments: '0 T 1 [x y w h]' where

     T=0: full screen, T=2: top window

     If x,  y, w, h are provided, this rectangle should be snapped. If
     XaAESSnap is not loaded, the external program that is defined  in
     xaaes.cnf for snapshots is called, if present.

 ACCPATH <character-sequence> Set  the location that XaAES will try to
     load accessories from (default is c:\).

 RESOURCE <character-
     sequence> main resource filename (default xaaes009.rsc)

     The system-resource-file has a version-number (currently  0.0.9),
     which  gives  xaaes009.rsc.  If  this  file is not found the name
     defined in xaaes.cnf is used if present.  If  not,  xaaes.rsc  is
     used.

 WIDGETS <character-
     sequence> widgets resource filename (default xaaeswdg.rsc)

 USEHOME <bool> use $HOME in shell_find

 NAES_COOKIE <bool> fake nAES cookie

 MENUPOP_PIDS <bool> Setting  menupop_pids = true makes XaAES list its
     clients in the client-list- menupopup using the following format;

     " PPID(RPPID) -> PID Client nice name"

     where 'PPID' is the physical parent-pid of the Client  (which  is
     the AESSYS). 'RPPID' is the Process ID of the process that called
     shel_write() to start it, it is the "Real Parent PID".  'PID'  is
     the  Process ID of the client. If set to 'no' (the default), only
     the client's nice name (when available, else its 'proc_name')  is
     listed.

 LRMB_SWAP <bool> Swap   left   and   right   mouse  buttons.  Setting
     'lrmb_swap = true' will make XaAES swap the left and right  mouse
     buttons.

 WIDGET_AUTO_HIGHLIGHT <bool> When  widget_auto_highlight is set true,
     standard window widget are automatically highlighted  when  mouse
     hovers  over  them.  This is still very experimental, and widgets
     are not actually highlighted, they are just animated  -  that  is
     redrawn in SELECTED status.

 REMAP_CICONS <bool> Use  the palette defined in the resource to remap
     icons.

 SET_RSC_PALETTE <bool> Use the palette defined  in  the  resource  as
     screen-palette.

 ALERT_WINDOWS <bitmask> default 0xffff alert_window   is   a  bitmask
     indicating which alerts coming via the alert pipe will  be  shown
     in  a  window. The idea is that this mask is used to tell the AES
     which alerts you want like this; bit 0 set -> show alerts with no
     icon  bit  1  set -> show alerts with INFO icon bit 2 set -> show
     alerts with QUESTION icon bit 3 set -> show alerts with STOP icon
     etc., etc.

     Because there  is  no consideration as to which icon is used (for
     example, kernel's PROCESS KILLED alerts have icon #1, the same as
     used  for other warnings/informative ALERTS), the implemention is
     not complete. So for now use this to either turn off or on alerts
     altogether.  To  turn on alert windows, use a mask where all bits
     are set, y0xffff, and to turn off clear all bits, 0x0000

     THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT DEFINATE AND ONLY PARTIAL AS OF NOW

 FONT_ID <number> (default 1) Standard GDOS fontid for windows & stuff

 STANDARD_POINT <number> (default 10) Size of the 'standard' AES  font
     (for window titles, etc), high resolution

 MEDIUM_POINT <number> (default 9) Size  of  the  'standard'  AES font
     (for window titles, etc), low resolution

 SMALL_POINT <number> (default 8) Size of the 'small' AES font.

 POPSCROLL <number> (default 0) Set number of lines of a  popup  above
     which it will be made scrollable

 DC_TIME <number/ms> (default 50) double click time (ms)

 MP_TIMEGAP <number/ms> (default 3) Mouse packet time-gap. This is the
     time (in 200hz timer ticks) that must pass after a button-release
     event  before  a new button-press event is accepted by moose.adi.
     Because of unstable  mouse-buttons,  a  button-press  may  follow
     immediately  after  a  button-release, creating an "extra" mouse-
     click. This is especially  annoying  when  releasing  the  right-
     button   after  a  drag-session  (Thing's  directory-window,  for
     example), and the "extra-click" fires some unwanted action.

 VIDEO <number> (default 1) See Video-Modes

 REDRAW_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default 500) This is the time in ms XaAES
     will  wait  for  clients  to  service  WM_REDRAW messages between
     actions that generate redraws,  like  moving/closing/opening/etc.
     windows.  If  a  client is busy and this 'timeout' happens, it is
     marked as lagging and XaAES will service the redraws for it. When
     this  happens,  XaAES just draws the areas not serviced with dark
     gray color until the  client  re-enters  evnt_multi().  For  slow
     machines,  this  timeout  must  be higher (longer) than on faster
     machines.

 POPUP_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default = 10) Time in milliseconds  before
     popups open.

 POPOUT_TIMEOUT <number/ms> (default 1000) Time in milliseconds before
     popups close.

 SETENV same as for mint.cnf

 NEXT_ACTIVE <'client' or 'window'> (default 'window') Selects  wether
     the  previous  active  application  or  the owner of the previous
     topped  (or  only)  window  should  be  set  active  upon  client
     termination.

 CLOSE_LASTWIND <'client' or 'window'> (default 'window') DEPRECIATED
     -  OBSOLETE  close_lastwind  =  'client'  or 'window' (default is
     'window')

     Selects what to do when the last window of a client is closed.

     Setting to 'client' will keep the application whose  last  window
     is  closed  as  the  top  application.  This  prevents XaAES from
     putting infront another application when the last window  of  the
     application currently infront is closed.

     Setting to  'window' will make XaAES put the application who owns
     the foremost window infront, making it active. This is the normal
     behaviour done by other AES's we thinks.

 APP_OPTIONS <string> See Commands for XaAES-clients.

 CANCEL <comma-separated string-list> List   of   words   that   XaAES
     interpretes as Cancel. A button containing a word from this  list
     in a dialog or alert will be selected if Undo is pressed.

 FILTERS <comma-separated string-list> List  of  patterns that will be
     contained in the  filter-menu  of  the  fileselector.  See  also:
     XaAES-Pattern-Matching.

 CTLALTA_SURVIVORS <comma-separated string-list> The  strings  are the
     filename part of the program file, padded with spaces  to  fit  8
     characters.  This  is  NOT  the  'nice' name. So, if your Toswin2
     binary is named "tw2.app", you  use  "tw2  ".  Each  app-name  is
     separated  with  comma.  This  will  allow  you  to specify which
     applications XaAES  does  not  attempt  to  terminate  when  user
     presses  CTRL-ALT-A  to  quit  all  applications.  Normally, this
     keycombo quits  all  running  applications  leaving  only  XaAES.
     However,  most  of the time, keeping certain applications running
     is  preferred,  such  as  the  desktop,  the  taskbar,  av-server
     application,  etc,  etc. One special name is '_aes_shell_', which
     will prevent XaAES from terminating the desktop loaded via "shell
     =  "  configuration  variable.  One can still use the name of the
     desktop program if it is konwn, but  an  easier  way  is  to  use
     '_aes_shell_',  as  that  will work without further configuration
     modifications when  one  changes  desktop  from,  say,  Thing  to
     Jinnee.  If  you  want  to  bypass  this  setting,  and  quit ALL
     applications, leaving only XaAES, you can press ctrl-alt-shift-a.

     The following will keep the desktop, taskbar and toswin2  running
     after a ctrl-alt-a action:

                          cltalta_survivors = "_aes_shell_", "taskbar ", "toswin2 "


     Applications that do not act on AP_TERM will also survive.

 KILL_WO_QUESTION <comma-separated string-list> Applications  found in
     this list will be killed immediately during  shutdown.  The  same
     rule as for CTLALTA_SURVIVORS applies to the strings

 ?MENU <'pull', 'push', 'leave', or 'nolocking'> (default 'leave')
     Determines  whether  a menu opens by hovering or clicking. If set
     to push menus have to be clicked to open. pull  is  the  same  as
     leave, nolocking has no effect.

 ?HELPSERVER <comma-separated string-list> List  of  apps  to  display
     help.

 VERTICAL_WHEEL_ID See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 HORIZONTAL_WHEEL_ID See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 VERTICAL_WHEEL_AMOUNT See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 HORIZONTAL_WHEEL_AMOUNT See Mousewheel-Configuration.

 ICNFY_... See Iconifying

 GRADIENTS <number> (default 0) setting gradients to a  nonzero  value
     turns  on  use  of  color  gradients in the window widget and aes
     object renderer in hc/tc color modes. This is  only  a  temporary
     configuration  that  will  be gone later on. Only turn this on if
     you have a fast machine.

 SHELL <string> Names the desktop-program

 RUN <string> Runs a program at startup. <string> is full-path\program


3.2  Commands for XaAES-clients
===============================

These may also affect XaAES itself.

The syntax is:

<app_option>: app_options = <app-name>, <options-list>

<options-list>: <options-list>, <option>

<option>: <option-name> = <value>

For option-name see below. Value may be a number or true/false.


3.2.1  Client-options
---------------------

 windowner

 nohide

 xa_nohide

 xa_nomove

 xa_objced

 xa_none

 noleft

 thinwork

 nolive

 wheel_reverse

 naesff

 naes12

 naes

 winframe_size

 inhibit_hide

 spaceXinsert <bool> (default false) exchanges  space/insert-behaviour
     in  dialogs and lists. If false, Insert will select a button in a
     dialog, space will select a list. This option  is  casesensitive,
     so for example SPACEXINSERT will not be recognized.

 clwtna

 alt_shortcuts <number> (default 3)

        . 0: no shortcuts

        . 1: shortcuts for alerts

        . 2: shortcuts for dialogs

        . 3: shortcuts for dialogs and alerts

     Controls how  XaAES  handles  Alt-shortcuts.  Since version 0.999
     every standard GEM-application  gets  Alt-shortcuts  for  dialogs
     that  use  form_do, even when there are no shortcuts defined with
     WHITEBAK in the resource-file.



4  Ctrl-Alt-Shortcuts
*********************

By pressing certain letters together with  Ctrl+Alt,  you  can  access
some more or less often used functions listed below.

   . A:  Terminates  all  applications  (A  list  of exceptions can be
     specified)

   . B: open System-window

   . E: open windows-submenu

   . T,Home: Redraw screen

   . D: Open the screenshot dialog - see snapshot config-option

   . P: Restore palette in colour depth of 8-bits or less

   . Q: Quit XaAES (deactivated - set HOTKEYQUIT in xa_defs.c 1 to use
     this)

   . R: Attempt to recover a system that has locked up

   . V: Unhide all applications

   . W: Global window cycling

   . X. Hide all except the currently focused application

   . Y: Hide currently focused application

   . space: Open main menu bar

   . Shift-space: Open menu in current window if it has one, else open
     main menubar

   . TAB: Cycle open applications

   . Cursor-right: full current window



5  XaAES Main-menu
******************


5.1  About
==========

Instead of listing lots of contributors to XaAES and part of  the  GPL
in  previous  versions,  the  main  web-address for MiNT, and the GPL-
copyright are mentioned.

Additionally the file 'xa_help.txt' is displayed if present.


5.2  System-Window
==================

In addition to the features described in

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.2.2

the following has been added:

   . Alerts have a timestamp and no '|' inside

   . "Environment"-Entries are sorted by name

   . New list-entry "System"

        - Screen-layout (resolution, bit-depth, pixel-format)

        - display CPU-info from /kern/cpuinfo

        - info about memory-protection

        - Kernel-version from /kern/version


5.3  Taskmanager
================

In addition to the features described in

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.4

the following has been added:

 List List is a tree, whereas clients are parent and their windows the
     children

 Select window or client If  exited with Ok, and a client is selected,
     this client is topped. If a window is selected,  this  window  is
     topped. Unselect with Space (or Insert).

 All processes Also lists non-AES-apps (not toppable, of course)

 Memory Displays memory-statistics found in /kern/meminfo

 Stop/Continue Similar  to  killing a process by clicking on the skull
     it may be stopped by clicking on the bed (the left one). Continue
     a  stopped process by clicking on the right bed (the one with the
     alarm)

 Load Display     actual     load      and      load-average      (see
     /doc/programmer/newcall.html/suptime.html).   By   selecting  the
     "toggle load"-button this can be switched off and on.

 Process-Information Displays more process-information in a table:

      ppid Process-ID of a processes parent

      pgrp The program-group of a process

      DOM Domain where 'M' is MiNT-domain, 'T' is TOS-domain.

      STATE where

           Cur: Current process

           Run: Process is running

           Wait: Process is waiting

           IO: Process is waiting for IO

           Zomb: Zombie

           TSR: Terminated and resident

           STOP: Stopped

           Slct: Waiting for IO in Fselect

          For more details refer to programmer/mint.txt



6  Fileselector
***************

Only changes from version 0.998 to 0.999 will be described here. For a
documentaion of the fileselector currently

http://xaaes.atariforge.net/docs.php?chapter=6.htm#6.3

is recommended.

The changes are mainly:


6.1  Keyboard
=============

   . PageUp/Down(Shift-CU/CD) pages the filelist.

   . The menu is opened by Ctrl-o.

   . If  an  entry  is selected in the list-box, Cursor-Right focusses
     the edit-field, so the selection can be edited.

   . By pressing Ctrl-C the path and  the  marked  file  (if  any)  is
     copied to the Clipboard.


6.2  File-Listing and Matching
==============================

   . Sorting  is  case-sensitive,  i.e.  Z is placed before a (like ls
     does on many systems).

   . File-Pattern is case-sensitive except the filesystem is uppercase
     (like  FAT)  or  the  caller runs in TOS-domain. See also: XaAES-
     Pattern-Matching.

   . If the fileselector finds a match  while  typing  that  match  is
     returned to the caller on OK (Return).



7  XaAES-Pattern-Matching
*************************

XaAES supports the following meta-characters for pattern-matching:

   . any character: '?'

   . any count of any character: '*'

   . character-class: '['<characters>']'

   . invert match: '!'

   . concatenate patterns: '|' between patterns

   . case-insensitivity of pattern: '|' first character

Matching *[],   *!,  *![],  !<whole  pattern>  is  possible.  Patterns
concatenated with | will result in any pattern  to  be  tested  for  a
match. This allows for example

     launchpath=<somepath>\*.prg|*.app|*.tos|*.ttp|*.acc|!*.*


to filter for extensions typical for executable files.

If '|'  is  the  first  character  the  whole  pattern-list is handled
caseinsensitive.

10  Miscellaneous
*****************


10.1  Features for XaAES-internal windows
=========================================

   . By pressing Ctrl-C the  selected  list-entry  is  copied  to  the
     Clipboard.

   . All XaAES-windows are resizable.

   . Keyboardnavigation in all lists:

        - List is selected

             * Cursor-right: open tree

             * Cursor-left: collapse

             * up/down: move the cursor

        - List is not selected

             * Cursor-right: scroll right

             * Cursor-left: scroll left

10.2  Single-Task Mode
======================

This has  been  introduced  to  be  able  to run some old but valuable
software that did not work with MiNT since  version  1.16  (and  maybe
earlier), especially the pure-debugger.

This implies:

   . Stop all AES-Clients.

   . Call  ikbd_scan  in the kernel directly not via addroottimeout in
     case the single-task-client disabled the timer-interrupt.

   . No main-menu of any other app is activated.

To control this currently there has to be the bit 16 (0x10000) set  in
p_flags of the relevant binary.

Any client  that  has bit 17 (0x20000) set, is not stopped except when
the single-task-app has this bit also set, i.e. when it  has  0x3xxxx.
This  may  be  important  because the single-task-client possibly does
tty-IO, and needs the toswin (or another) console.

To setup an application for this run

     flags  <app>


and remember the value displayed.

Then run

     flags -f 0x1xxxx <app>.


where the 'x' are the previously displayed values.

If a program shall not be stopped do the same but with

     flags -f 0x2xxxx <app>


on that program-file.
