NOTES for XaAES multi language support:

- For XaAES language selection, please add a line "lang = xx" in xaaes.cnf where "xx" is the
  code for your preferred language:
  en  english
  de  german
  fr  french  (Thanks to JFL)
  es  spanish  (Thanks to David)
  it  italian  (Thanks to Lodovico)
  hu  hungarian  (Thanks to Joszef)
  ru  russian  (Thanks to Dima)
  cs  czech  (Thanks to Bohdan)

- Add "rsc_lang = 1" to line "app_options = aessys, ...":

  app_options = aessys, thinwork = ..., rsc_lang = 1

All translations for XaAES are located in file xaaes*.rsl (in xaaes folder).
You may add any other two-character-language-code, add your translation-strings in the rsl-file
and perhaps send the rsl-file to MiNTlist (zipped and attached because of possible mailclient encoding
problems). Any additional language is welcome!
 
- XaAES can read out the resource strings of EVERY STARTING APP and create a .rsl file for it. This
  is selectable in xaaes.cnf, too. Just add another parameter to the according "app_options= " line:

  "rsc_lang = 0" No translation file (default setting).
  "rsc_lang = 1" Read an existing translation file (or create, if not present)
  "rsc_lang = 2" Always create a translation file (overwrite existing one)

  The .rsl file is created in the same folder where the rsc-file is, you can edit (translate) it and,
  at next program start, XaAES replaces the original resource texts with the translated ones (according
  to setting of option "lang =" in xaaes.cnf).

  If your translated string is longer than the original, you may replace the "nn:" by "nn+" before the
  original. Then the translation will be reallocated.

  Useful only for menus:
  It's enough to use + before the menu-TITLE, e.g. nn+ Options. The whole Options-menu will be resized then.

- English, german, french, spanish, italian and hungarian version can be used with default Atari charset (fonts).
- For russian version you have to install either d_kyr_*.fnt set (Atari systemfont style, located in ./fonts/ru/)
  or l_kyr_*.fnt set (Monaco font style) in NVDI or fvdi as system fonts.
  There's a russian keyboard table "russian.tbl" for MiNT, too (based on LVAFONTS.ACC layout from B. A. Lewitzki).
- For czech version you have to install iso2a-16.fnt, iso2a-8.fnt and iso2a-6-fnt in NVDI or fvdi as system
  fonts (located in ./fonts/cs/).
