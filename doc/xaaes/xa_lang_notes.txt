NOTES for XaAES multi language support:

- For XaAES language selection, please add a line "lang = xx" in xaaes.cnf where "xx" is the
  code for your preferred language:
  en  english
  de  german
  fr  french  (Thanks to JFL)
  es  spanish  (Thanks to David)
  hu  hungarian  (Thanks to Joszef)
  ru  russian  (Thanks to Dima)
  cs  czech  (Thanks to Bohdan)

You may also add any other two-character-language-code, and add your
translation-strings in the rsl-file.

- XaAES can read out the resource strings of every started app and generate an .rsl file for it. This
  is selectable in xaaes.cnf, too. Just add another parameter to the according "app_options= " line:
  "rsc_lang = 0" for no translation file.
  "rsc_lang = 1" for generate (or read, if present) a translation file.

  To enable this for XaAES:
   app_options = aessys, thinwork = ..., rsc_lang = 1

	Or any other app-name where translation should take place.

  as system fonts. There's a russian keyboard table "russian.tbl" for MiNT, too.
