It has been a very long time since the last official FreeMiNT kernel release.
1.16 was only ever released in a BETA form and the 1.15 release dates back over
10 years. The new 1.17.0 release is a culmination of 1.16 over the years with
some notable new items and bug fixes.

One thing that this release really lacks is Frank Naumann. Frank passed
away on the 12th March 2010. He will be sorely missed from the Atari community
and this release is dedicated to him and the efforts he made during his life.
