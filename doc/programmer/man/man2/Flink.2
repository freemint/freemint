.nf
LONG Flink( char *oldname, char *newname );

.I Flink
creates a new name (a "hard link") for the file currently named
.IR oldname .

either name, and a call to
.I Fdelete
on either name will not affect access to the file through the other
name.

.I newname
must both refer to files on the same physical device. Note also that not
all file systems allow links.

.I oldname
does not currently exist

links.
