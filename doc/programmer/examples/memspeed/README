This programs allocates 2 MB of the memory (from the fast ram, if
present), splits the block to two parts a 1 MB, then copies one to another
32 times using several different methods.

Since new MiNT functions are used to measure timings and control caches,
you'd need at least MiNT 1.15.0 (MiNT 1.15.1 and up is recommended).

While the program is running on a Falcon, you can observe a very
interesting effect how the 68030 data cache degrades (yes, DEGRADES) the
performance.

But, do not be quick getting conclusions: on a system where data burst is
operational (on normal Falcon it is not, enabling it has no effect), i.e. 
for example on a ct2, the data cache enabled suppsedly increases the
performance. So do not disable the cache in own programs, even if you
think it is advantageous. Let the user decides (if he has a CPX for that,
that it).
