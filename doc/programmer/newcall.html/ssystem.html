<b>S_CTRLCACHE</b><br>(0x0017)
</center>
<td>Provides an universal (among 68k family members) way of controlling
the CPU on chip caches. The <b><i>arg1</b></i>, referenced as Cache
Control Word (CCW) is a bitfield where each bit enables (if 1) or
disables (if 0) a particular function of CPU caches. The
<b><i>arg2</b></i>, referenced as Cache Control Mask (CCM), is a bit
mask where you define (by setting appropriate bits to 1) which bits of
the Cache Control Word should be actually taken into account and
written into the Cache Control Register (CACR). This is <i>control
mode</i> of the <b>S_CTRLCACHE</b>.
<p>In <i>inquire mode</i> you can pass -1 as either argument. If the
CCW is -1, the call returns a longword reflecting the actual state of
the caches.
<p>If the CCM is -1, a default bitmask is returned, where any bit set
indicates, that a cache function defined by the same bit in the
Cache Control Word is valid for the processor the MiNT is currently
running on.
<p>If both arguments are negative, the call simply returns <b>E_OK</b>
if it is valid at all or <b>ENOSYS</b> otherwise. This is the
<i>acknowledge mode</i> of the <b>S_CTRLCACHE</b>.
<p>Bits in either argument are defined as follows:
<pre>
0	enable instruction cache
1	enable data cache
2	enable branch cache
3	freeze instruction cache
4	freeze data cache
5	instruction burst enable
6	data burst enable
7	enable write allocate
8	instruction cache full mode enable
9	instruction cache read/write allocate enable
10	data cache full mode enable
11	data cache read/write allocate enable
12	invalidate branch cache
13	invalidate branch cache user entries
14	enable CPUSH invalidate
15	enable store buffer
16-31	reserved for future definition
</pre>
<p>Notice, that no processor currently supports all of these functions
and some (68000 and 68010) have no on-chip caches at all. To figure
out, what functions are valid for the actual CPU used, you should first
request the default bitmask using the <i>inquire mode</i> described
above. Your program should save this mask, logically AND the
<b><i>arg2</i></b> with it, then pass the result as the Cache Control
Mask for a <i>control mode</i> call.
<p><b>Also notice, that the above bit definition does not exactly
reflect the function and even position of actual bits in the physical
Cache Control Register</b>. The bits of either argument are arbitrarily
assigned to particular cache functions, but their position and state
are converted by the system before the Cache Control Register is
written and after it is read, so that the user program can see always
the same functions assigned to bits as above regardless of the physical
configuration of the Cache Control Register.</p>

</p>
<p>The <b>S_FLUSHCACHE</b>, <b>S_CTRLCACHE</b>, <b>S_DEBUGLEVEL</b> and
<b>S_DEBUGDEV</b> are supported as of MiNT version 1.15.1 release.</p>
<p>You should <b>never</b> use <b>Ssystem(S_TIOCMGET, ...);</b> in own
programs.</p>
<p>The <b>Ssystem()</b> behaviour does <i>not</i> depend on the
<b>S_SECLEVEL</b> settings.<p>
<p>Any values returned by the kernel on <i>reserved</i> fields should
be considered undocumented and no software should rely on
them.

<tr><th><b>Comments</b></th><td colspan=2>Its strictly encouraged to
access GEMDOS variables and system vectors via the <b>Ssystem()</b>,
because this way is considered safe for multiuser setups. For example,
you can access the cookie jar pointer using <b>Ssystem(S_GETLVAL,
0x05a0, NULL)</b>, though if TOS compatibility is the issue, you should
rather use <b>Setexc(0x05a0>>2, -1)</b>.
<p>Prior to any further <b>Ssystem()</b> usage, your application should
first check if the kernel supports this call. If it does, the
<b>Ssystem(-1, 0L, 0L);</b> should return a zero.
<p><b>Ssystem()</b> is used and supported by the MiNT Library
as of patchlevel 48.
