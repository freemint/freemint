- the lower right corner is not accessible in tw52
- characters sets GF0, GR1, and GR2 missing
- function and cursor keys don't always work with tw52
- resizing the window may crash toswin, be careful.  Will be fixed soon.
- switching to line drawing mode in tw100 is merely heuristics
- some redraw errors with resizing and changing scrollback buffer
- cvvis does not work correctly
