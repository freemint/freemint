	+ amend the REP test to not reset colors if it happens to be run via
	  the menu entry for BCE-related tests.

20140116
	+ cosmetic changes (suggested by Itay Chamiel):

	  + clear screen just before resetting SCS in menu #3 character sets,
	    in case a VT100 emulator does not simply ignore VT220 G2/G3
	    selections when it does not implement them.

	  + add check for maximum operating level before deciding whether
	    to send a DECSCL to set it to VT100-level.

	  + adjust starting point of items for menu #9 "Test of known bugs"
	    to avoid overwriting part of the description of the test.

20130915
	+ when NRCS is active, suppress ISO Latin-1 from menu to avoid

20130818
	+ modify character-sets screens to optionally highlight the characters
	  which do not correspond to ISO-8859-1.  This makes the National
	  Replacement Characters easier to see.

	+ modify DSR cursor-position report to check if the terminal 
	  accounts for origin-mode.

	+ support --datarootdir option in makefile.in, to match configure
	  script updates.

	+ updated configure macros:

	  + change from byacc for autoheader

	  + improved checks for gcc attributes

	  + improved checks for gcc version

	  + miscellaneous fixes in CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

20120603
	+ change cursor-position before IL/DL in 
	  "Test of VT102-style features with BCE (Insert/Delete Char/Line)"
	  to demonstrate whether the terminal sets the cursor to the first
	  column as a side-effect, as noted in VT220 reference manual.

20120506
	+ build-fix in case compiler does not recognize gcc's __attribute__.

	+ modify vt420 rectangle menu to allow testing with applications which
	  misreport their operating level, e.g., Reflection which states that
	  it is a vt340.  The menu title shows "should not work" if the
	  terminal says its operating level is below VT4xx.

	+ add menu-entries for DECOM/DECLRMM to vt420 rectangle menu.

	+ add menu-entries for DECOM/DECLRMM to vt420 cursor-movement menu.

	+ add menu-entries for DECOM/DECLRMM to vt420 editing-controls menu.

	+ add HPR and VPR test-screens.

	+ add vt520 cursor-movement menu; most of the vt520's new features were
	  based on ISO-6429 but allow for DECOM and DECLRMM interactions.

	+ implement DECSCPP and DECSLPP test-screens.

	+ add test-screen for DECNCSM.

	+ add "-s" command-line option to initialize the time-delay feature.

	+ add setup-menu feature to control whether a time delay is added in
	  selected repeated cursor-movement and scrolling operations to make
	  their behavior easier to see.

	+ correct scanning of DECCKSR response; result is hexadecimal not
	  decimal.

	+ modify menu functions to provide for multipage menus, e.g., in the
	  character set choices for vt420 and vt520 on a 24-line screen.

	+ modify tests related to left/right margins to allow color to be set,
	  as xterm-feature.

	+ add test-screen for index/reverse index with left/right margins.

	+ ensure that status-line is turned off when exiting status-line test.

	+ add test-screen for VT420 & up for ASCII formatting controls with
	  margins.

	+ modify DECFI/DECBI tests to work with margins.

	+ add menu entries for setting/showing the top/bottom and left/right
	  margins, to modify the behavior of the DECIC/DECDC tests.

	+ add menu entries for setting/showing DECLRMM state, needed for
	  DECIC/DECDC tests.

	+ change mnemomic DECVSSM to DECLRMM to reflect the latter's usage in
	  vt420 and vt510 manuals.

	+ modify DECRQSS test for DECSCUSR to show if the response is as
	  expected.

20111210
	+ modify mouse menu's selection of coordinate mode to include xterm's
	  1006 and urxvt's 1015 controls.

	+ fix inchar() function to work properly with big-endian machines
	  (patch by David Kutalek).

20110506
	+ add some VT520-level menus, e.g., for DSR, DECRQSS.

	+ add VT220 test for DSR Operating Status Report.

20100830
	+ modify mouse tests to show DECRPM results for the mouse modes, if
	  DECRQM is enabled, i.e., level is VT300 and up.

	+ modify mouse tests to work with xterm #262's UTF-8 coordinates.

	+ add menu entries for xterm #224's focus-event and xterm #262's UTF-8
	  coordinates.

	+ add xterm-specific screen for DECRQM/DECRPM.

	+ modify configure script to support program name-transformation
	  options.

	+ drop mkdirs.sh, use "mkdir -p".

	+ add RPM and Debian package scripts, for testing.

20100528
	+ correct check of fflush return code, which interfered with demo of
	  xterm window-modification controls.

	+ fix most strict compiler warnings, e.g., writable strings.

	+ updated configure macros:

	  + quoting fixes

	  + improve portability for ctags

	  + improve check for gcc version

	  + simplify -D options in CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

	+ update config.guess, config.sub

20100101
	+ add screen for vt520 features, e.g., DECSCUSR.

	+ cosmetic for querying xterm-fonts.

20091231
	+ add test-screens for setting/querying xterm fonts.

	+ improve display for 94-item character set tests by assuming that
	  DEL would be ignored, and writing a blank after it rather than
	  allowing a ')' to be mapped in the selected character set.

	+ check whether terminal is vt220 or vt320 to decide which Latin-1
	  flavor to use for initializing the character set tests.

	+ miscellaneous fixes for configure script macros.

	+ updated config.guess, config.sub

20071216

	+ build-fix for Darwin 8.8 or OS X 10.4.x, (report by David Blanchard).

20070107
	+ contacted Per Lindberg (2007/1/2), received permission to change his
	  copyright notice to a BSD-style license.

20061126
	+ add screen to DECCRA test to demonstrate if video attributes are
	  copied along with the window, or supplied from the current attributes.

	+ use CF_XOPEN_SOURCE in configure script to get prototype for usleep()
	  on Linux.

	+ updated config.guess, config.sub

	  longer than a single line.

	+ improve configure script checks for Intel compiler warning options.

	+ add "%u" format needed in va_out() to work with 20050107 change
	  to mouse-highlight test.

	+ add initialization to disable tab/space conversion during menu items
	  1 and 2, e.g., when "stty tab3" is set (report by Pavel Cahyna).

20041205
	+ add the ability to redraw the screen for mouse-tests, since some can
	  produce lots of output, e.g., the any-event tracking.

	+ modify function which reads replies, e.g., from DA, to retry as long
	  as it has read data.  This is needed for connecting to real VTxxx
	  terminals vs emulators (report by Pavel Cahyna).

20041107
	+ modify lib$wait() call to work on IA64, which uses a different default
	  float format than VAX and Alpha.

	+ update vmsbuild.com and descrip.mms to build on IA64.

	+ fix typo in vmsbuild.com

20040804
	+ change parameter for ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &param) to an int.

	+ add a test screen for BCE color behavior with ECH, DCH and scrolling.

	+ add a demo of some of the VT100 autowrap behavior to menu 1.

	+ add xterm's control sequence to disable reverse wraparound to the
	  initialization (this would conflict with DECGPCS if that were tested,
	  but eliminates some user confusion in menu-1).

	+ add entries for VT520/VT525 DA2 responses.

	+ decode DA1 response for VT125.

	+ add note in REP test regarding undefined behavior from using two
	  REP controls in a row (report by Brian Pence).

	+ change SPA test to allow setting/unsetting ERM while running it
	  (request by Brian Pence).

	+ add VT420, VT520 entries to table for DECRPM test, and split that
	  into VT320- and VT420-only tests.

	+ add VT520 entries to character-set and keyboard dialect tables.

	+ correct cleanup from menu 3 (see 990120), which left G1-G3 set to
	  tested character sets rather than resetting to ASCII.

	+ split-out vt320.c, modifying VT220- and VT420-menus to avoid
	  most duplication by pointing to lower-level terminals in the menu.

	+ correct message from check_rc() in xterm.c (report by Brian Pence).

	+ add --disable-echo option to configure script

	+ update configure script.

20030301
	+ add tek4014 test menu, for xterm.

20021208
	+ improved test for cursor-control sequences within escape sequences
	  (patch by Paul Williams).

20020422
	+ modify keyboard tests for cursor- and keypad-application modes to
	  reset the keyboard back to normal mode at the end of each test
	  (reported by Takashi SHIRAI <shirai@nintendo.co.jp>).

	+ modify test-screen for DEC locator events to add a function that checks
	  for the screensize, used for XFree86 xterm to scale the pixel reports.

	+ updates to configure script and makefile:  omit dependencies on
	  config.status and improve list of gcc warning options.

20011130
	+ add tests for xterm alternate screen

	+ split-out xterm mouse tests into mouse.c menu.

20000208
	+ change coding of wheel-mouse events, XFree86 xterm patch #126.

991228
	+ modify to report wheel-mouse events for XFree86 xterm (patch #122).

991025
	+ clarify top-level reports menu, which mixes tests that apply to various
	  models (VT100-VT420).

	+ show decoded modifiers for the xterm mouse tests

991014
	+ modify position of cursor for printer tests, so autoprint tests work
	  as expected.

	+ correct escape sequence for mc_print_page().

991007
	+ implement tests for Media Copy, e.g., transparent printing.

	+ add examples for DEC locator events and DSR responses.

	+ add DA responses for VT50 and VT55 (I'd forgotten that I once bought a
	  DECscope booklet).

990712
	+ modify menu 3.12 (non-VT100 "Test Keyboard Layout with G0 Selection")
	  to show numeric codes as well as the actual character.

	+ remove spurious test for SD which indicated that ISO's coding differed
	  from DEC's.  The difference was a typographical error in ECMA-48
	  (reported by Paul Williams <paul@celigne.co.uk>).

990120
	+ correct initialization of G0, for character-set shift-in/shift-out test.

	+ change keyboard layout screen so that, when invoked from the character
	  set menu, it will display NRC characters properly.

	+ correct logic of reset_charset() function, which used the wrong index
	  for do_scs() (reported by Jeffrey Altman).

	+ set/restore character set for keyboard layout test in character-set
	  menu.

990119
	+ add menu entry for enabling NRC mode, and (for VT220 & up) a menu
	  entry to allow testing keyboard layout with NRC mode enabled.

	+ remove logic that sets NRC mode from setup for character-set tests,
	  since that interferes with new menu entry.

	+ change delimiting characters for single-shift test screen from "{" and
	  "}" to "(" and ")" to avoid confusion (the DECterm program which I have
	  tested with maps the curly braces even in an unshifted state according
	  to the state of the NRC mode).

	+ reset character-set of G0 after tst_vt100_charsets

	+ restore terminal modes after answerback test.
  
980719
	+ add tests to illustrate any-event and button-event tracking in XFree86
	  xterm.

980328
	+ add logic to ensure we pick up the proper choice (e.g., in Norwegian)
	  where the choice depends on the terminal id (e.g., VT220 vs VT320).

	+ minor correction for VT220 vs VT320 logic in do_scs for Latin-1 vs
	  British character set.

980327
	+ implement test for single-shift (SS2 and SS3).

980326
	+ implement shift-in/shift-out character-set tests oriented toward VT220.

	+ several corrections to VT220 character-set tests, from reports by
	  Kenneth R. Robinette <zkrr01@mailbox.neosoft.com>:

	  + move SCS strings to immediately before/after the tests to
	    avoid conflict with menu selection, and to keep the tests
	    distinct.

	  + use 96-character control sequences only for character sets
	    (Latin 1), and 94-character control sequences for the
	    National Replacement Characters.

	  + add ISO Latin-1 as a font option

	  + add Swiss as a font option

980310
	+ decode known values for secondary DA response.

	+ make mouse-highlight test a little clearer by putting '+' marks at the
	  corners of the highlight-region.

970524
	+ eliminate 'gets()' calls, which can overflow buffer.

970520
	+ implement CF_FCNTL_VS_IOCTL check to make this build on SCO 3.x and
	  CLIX, which are both non-POSIX systems.

970518
	+ add CF_POSIX_VDISABLE test to work around gcc 2.6.2 bug.

970419
	+ correct sign-extension in xterm mouse-position

961215
	+ correct err introduced between d960905 and v2_5 that broke test for IRM
	  mode by using decsclm (reported by Jeffrey Altman).

961125
	+ add VT220 character-set tests for locking-shifts

VERSION 2.7

961113
	+ corrected early return from test for DECRPM when badly-formatted
	  reply is received.

	+ add DA1 codes from VT500 manual (from Jeffrey Altman).

	+ refined test to restore ANSI mode based on VT420 testing.

961029
	+ extend VT52 test to check operating level when restoring ANSI mode.

961028
	+ implemented tests for VT220/VT420 function keys, editing keypad.

961027
	+ set the terminal's default operating level to the maximum rather than
	  VT100; this is slightly incompatible with VTTEST 1.7 (suggested by
	  Jeffrey Altman)

960930
	+ amended reset_colors() to do SGR 0 at the end.

960928
	+ allow 8-bit input for keyboard (function keys, cursor keys) tests.

	+ correct I/O modes on timeout

	+ added padding, corrected some states on return from VT52 tests.

	+ increase buffer size for DECTSR.

960927
	+ modified scan_chr (used in DECCIR test) to properly diagnose Pericom's
	  3.2 emulator.

	+ check in setup-menu for VT52.

	+ modify inputline to retain whitespace

	+ modify 'reset_colors()' to accommodate grossly-nonstandard emulators
	  that don't reset colors with SGR 0.

	+ added test for SGR 0

960921
	+ implement REP test

	+ corrected highlighting refresh in function-key test

	+ use raw-mode for VT52 DECID test.

VERSION 2.6

960911
	+ corrected DECBI, DECFI (documentation from Jeffrey Altman), SRM (on
	  VT420) tests.

960908
	+ implement DECDLD tests. Tested with fonts from "The VT200 TOOLKIT" by
	  Tabik & DiGiantomasso, Professional Software (available via DECUS).

960905
	+ implement DECCARA, DECRARA, DECSACE, DECSERA tests.

960828
	+ provide analysis of DECCIR

	+ implement tests for DECSASD, DECSSDT

960825

	  locked, so that only the first key definition was used (reported by
	  Jeffrey Altman).

	+ Corrected test for DECRPM, missing '?' (reported by Jeffrey Altman
	  <jaltman@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>).

VERSION 2.5

960818
	+ implements most VT420 report-tests.

	+ make menu-skeleton for VT420 tests (some are needed for xterm tests),
	  marking the non-implemented entries with an '*'.

960817
	+ add tests/examples for xterm mouse controls

960816
	+ remove obsolete support for Sargasso C (TOPS-20)

960813
	+ use usleep() if the system has it, to make responses faster.

	+ add menu-entry for toggling 7/8-bit input/output controls

	+ split-out keyboard.c, organized by a set of submenus.

	+ split-out reports.c, parameterized to allow testing 8-bit controls.

VERSION 2.4

960807
	+ Implement test for VT5xx C7C1T and S8C1T

	+ Remove check for scrolling-behavior in CPL and CNL (no one but kermit
	  seems to consider doing this).

	+ Modified tst_reports() to use raw mode (the original sgtty logic
	  doesn't do this) so that termios works.  Modified termios settings for
	  crmod so it doesn't touch INLCR and IGNCR, and for raw mode to leave
	  c_oflag alone - this works on Linux.

	+ corrected some typos in DECSCA test.

960806
	+ Testing by Albert D. Cahalan <acahalan@cs.uml.edu> with VT510,
	  suggested initializing with the 80/132 mode enabled.  Says real
	  terminals need padding...

960804
	+ Implement tests for: SL, SD, SU, SR

	+ Modified "Test of screen features with ISO 6429 SGR 22-27 codes"
	  to test concealed text.

	+ Implement tests for the following ISO 6429 controls:  CBT, CHA, CHT,
	  CNL, CPL, ECH, HPA, SL, SPA, SR, VPA.

	+ Implement tests for DEC VT220 controls:  DECSCA, DECTCEM

960802
	+ Restructure non-VT100 menus, making them separate from the base VT100
	  tests.

VERSION 2.2

960721
	+ Initialize terminal with 80/132 switching enabled

	+ Casper Dik <casper@holland.Sun.COM> explained why tests fail on Solaris
	  2.5 (can workaround with lots of fflush calls ;-)

960716
	+ Add tests for CDE-compatible xterm

VERSION 2.1

960708
	+ Change background color to blue for tests (some yellows and greens
	  are too close together).

960702
	+ Added extended graphic-rendition tests (ISO 6429)

VERSION 2.0

960624
	+ Added color/graphic-rendition, and color-scrolling tests.

960623
	+ Implemented color tests (test-pattern, bce-test, insert/delete lines)

960621
	+ Implemented auto-config for termios (tested on SunOS 4.1.1, IRIX 5.2,
	  Solaris 5.4).

960618
	+ Modified to support nonstandard screen geometry.  For example, you can
	  test Linux console (which has 25 lines) by typing 'vttest 25'.

	+ Implemented auto-config for termio (tested on SunOS 4.1.1).

960617
	+ Corrected broken write-to-string-constant in tst_keyboard().

	+ Split-out logic for ttymodes.c

	+ Converted to ANSI C (it's a lot easier to avoid breaking code when all
	  of the interfaces are fully specified).

	+ Split-out sargasso.h from header.h, to avoid nested-comment syntax.  (I
	  don't think anyone will be using that again, anyway).

	+ from original version (I've found nothing more recent ;-), marked 1.7b
	  1985-04-19, begin making changes to support testing for ANSI color
	  features.
