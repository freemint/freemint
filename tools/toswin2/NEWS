Version 2.7 - 7 April 2001

* colors are now fully ansi-compatible 

* terminal capabilities `bold' and `dim' are now represented using
  light resp. half-bright colors where applicable

* support for alternate character set (pc graphics)

* TERM is automatically set to `tw52-m' or `tw100-m' if less than
  8 colors are available

* terminfo source files updated (many bugfixes), recompile
  it with tic on the target system

* environment variable COLORTERM is set to 1 if color support available

* The horizontal slider has vanished.  If you want to get it back
  call me at office hours and keep your credit card at hand.  Please
  allow six weeks for delivery.

* The checkbox for so-called auto-wrapping has vanished.  Explanation:
  It really enabled semi-automatic margins, i. e. printing in the
  last column caused a line-break.  Now both tw52 and tw100 have
  proper automatic margins and there is no more need for such a
  user-definable feature.
