mkfatfs, filesystem tool
========================

Here is the first public release of mkfatfs, a filesystem creation tool.
Main reason for this programm is to build TOS and DOS FAT32 partitions also
on ATARI computers.

Sorry, it's a commandline tool. Contact me if you will write
a graphical user interface.


Ok, what is FAT32 you ask now?

FAT32 is a extension of the existing FAT definition. The FAT (File
Allocation Table) on existing partitions is 16 bit wide.
This limits the maximum number of cluster to 65536 (under TOS
to 32768 because of some bugs). So if you need large partitions
you must increase cluster size. But this has a negative side effect.
Large cluster also increase 

It requires a harddiskdriver that support at least XHDI level 1.10.

If you start mkfatfs without any parameter, you get the
following output:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./mkfatfs 0.2b, 1998-08-01 for TOS and DOS FAT/FAT32-FS
Found XHDI level 1.30.

No drive specified.

Usage: ./mkfatfs [OPTIONS] drv:
  -c            Check filesystem as is gets built
  -f <num>      Number of FATs (between 1 and 4)
  -F <num>      FAT size (12, 16, or 32)
  -i <id>       Volume ID as hexadecimal number (i.e. 0x0410)
  -l <filename> Bad block filename
  -m <filename> Boot message filename--text is used as a boot message
  -n <name>     Volume name
  -r <num>      Root directory entries (not applicable to FAT32)
  -s <num>      Sectors per cluster (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128)
  -a            Create filesystem always (disables partition ID checking)
