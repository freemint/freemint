This document describes in short how to install and use HypView.

Installation
------------
HypView can be used as normal application or as accessory.
By setting the STGUIDE and/or HELPVIEWER environment variable to
the full path to HypView, it's possible for other applications to
start it if necessary.
Set your desktop to open *.HYP files using HypView. If you like you
can set HypView as default viewer.


Usage
-----
HypView has been written to replace ST-Guide. Therefore it's working
"as the original". The icons in the toolbar are nearly identical.
From left to right:
  -"Back": jumps back to the page which lead to the current page
  -"History": displays a history popup which allows jumping back
   to a specific page.
  -"Bookmarks": Allows you to select and define your fovorite pages
  -"Previous": Go to previous page
  -"Home": Go to parent page of the current page.
  -"Next": Go to next page
  -"Index": Display index of all pages/nodes defined.
  -"Catalog": Display the catalog hypertext (defined in the HypView
   configuration file)
  -"See also...": Displays a popup which suggests further readings.
  -"Help": Jump to help page of the current hypertext.
  -"Info": Displays some information about HypView and the current
   hypertext file.
  -"Load": Opens a fileselector to load a new file.
  -"Save": Opens a fileselector to select a filename to which the
   current selection (or the current page) is saved.
  -"Extra": Displays a popup (=same as the right-click context menu)
   which provides access to further operations.
