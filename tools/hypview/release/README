Project HypView
===============

Description
-----------
The project HypView aims at developing a free ST-Guide replacement.
ST-Guide is hypertext viewer for TOS compatible systems and used
to display online help in many applications. It allows to read
documentations not only in a linear manner (from beginning to end),
but also to freely jump across chapters by clicking on a highlighted
text passage. Today this is a very familiar concept for everybody
browsing through the world wide web using HTML pages.
ST-Guide files are recognized by their file extension (HYP) and are
often accompanied by .REF files.


History
-------
This project was started by Philipp Donze in 2001 as a private,
one-man project. Until beginning of 2004 a varying number of beta 
testers helped to improve the application. Thanks to the contributions
of Gerhard Stoll, the project progressed more until 2006 when the
sources have gone "public" under the initiative of Odd Skancke (which
ported also the sources to gcc).
Today the project (including its sources) is freely available under 
the GNU Public License (GPL, provided in COPYING). The latest source
code is available through the CVS repository of FreeMiNT (in the 
'freemint/tools/hypview' directory).
