Project: HypView
================
This project is in (constant) evolution. I.e. this version is not
the final version. Nevertheless you can test and use the current
application. But beware:

  This application is in an early state and some features are not
  yet fully tested. While using this program you should be sure that
  program or the whole system may crash.

  The program comes WITHOUT warranty of any kind!
  Use it at your OWN RISK!


If you observe problems or suspicious behavior, please contact me, so
that I can release an updated version of the application. (You can
find the latest version on my web site.)

I'm also glad to receive any comments, ideas and suggestions!
