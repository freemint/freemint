3  Usage
********


3.1  retrieving wiki-source
===========================

Download the xml-file from the wiki using

     getxml <Chapter>


To download the MiNT-usermanual for example enter:

     getxml User_manual


This will produce the file

     User_manual.xml


in you local directory.


3.2  Convert from wiki to udo
=============================

You get udo-source from wiki-xml by entering

     awk -f w2u.awk -v INF=<wiki-source>


or simply

     w2u <wiki-source>


The output-filename will have the same base as  the  source  with  the
extension .wu.

For example to convert the MiNT-usermanual to udo enter:

     awk -f w2u.awk -v INF=User_manual.xml


This will produce the file

     User_manual.wu


Now you can convert this using udo to any format you need.


3.3  Convert from udo to wiki
=============================

You get wiki-source from udo-source by entering

     awk -f u2w.awk -v <udo-source>


or simply

     w2u <udo-source>


The output-filename  will  have  the  same base as the source with the
extension .wik.

To convert the MiNT-usermanual to wiki enter:

     awk -f u2w.awk -v INF=User_manual.wu


This produces

     User_manual.wik


which can be imported into the wiki by copy/paste.

If you want local links for nodes and labels in  the  wiki-output  you
need to create a file

     <udo-source>.n


which contains a list of all nodes and labels.

You can create this file by running

     egrep "(^!(sub)*node|^!label)" <udo-source> ><udo-source>.n
