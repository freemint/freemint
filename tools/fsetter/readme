short description:
==================

1. select a drive

2. all non supported options are disabled

3. General options:

VFAT
	- enable/disable VFAT extension on this drive
	- supported from NEWFATFS
	
MagiC sym-links
	- enable/disable MagiC style symlinks on this drive;
	- WinNT doesn't like MagiC style symlinks for example,
	  that's why exist this option
	- supported from NEWFATFS
	
Write-Back Cache
	- enable/disable Write-Back mode on this drive
	  Write-Back means that write access is buffered; this will
	  extremly speedup a lot of operations
	  It's not recommended to disable this option on MinixFS
	- always safe (also if operations are performed at the moment
	  on this drive)
	- supported from MinixFS and NEWFATFS

4. Name mode:

- supported from NEWFATFS
- only available for if VFAT extension is disabled
- restrict allowed characters for new file names
  - GEMDOS - all GEMDOS characters, default
  - ISO - characters after ISO (characters, digits, underscore)
  - MSDOS - all MSDOS chracters are allowed

5. FAT32:

- supported from NEWFATFS
- only available on FAT32 partitions
- FAT Mirroring enable/disable FAT Mirroring
  that means all FAT or only the specified FAT is updated
  if you disable FAT Mirroring, you must first specify the active
  FAT, active FAT can be 1 to 'Number of FATs'

6. Info:

- print some information about this drive and the description
  of the filesystem running

7. Change - apply the actual settings
   Quit - leave this dialog without any change
   Change + Quit - set actual settings and leave dialog


Have fun.
If there is any question ask me or Christian Felsch.
