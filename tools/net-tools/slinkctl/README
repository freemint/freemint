SLINKCTL.TTP
------------
SLINKCTL is a command-line program for controlling SCSILINK.XIF.    It
retrieves statistics, clears statistics, and/or resets the device.  The
statistics are intended to help in problem determination, so will not be
very meaningful to the end user; however, if you have a problem, we may
ask you to run it and send the results to Anodyne Software.  SLINKCTL
has the following syntax:

    slinkctl [-c] [-r] [-tN] <interface>

By default (i.e. with no optional parameters) it reports internal statistics
including the trace for the interface named <interface>.  If one or more
of the options is set, the appropriate actions are carried out but no
report is created.

Available options:
    -c    clears the statistics counters
    -r    resets the interface (useful if it seems to be hung)
    -tN   sets the number of entries in the trace table to N; N must
          be between 0 & 10000 inclusive.  NOTE: the trace table is
          mostly for use during development, and is not likely to
          mean much to the casual user.  It's recommended that you
          leave the number of entries at zero (the default).

Output is to stdout.

Examples:
   slinkctl.ttp en0
      writes the statistics for port 'en0' to stdout
   slinkctl.ttp -c en0
      clears the statistics for port 'en0'
   slinkctl.ttp -r en1
      resets the SCSI/Link device at port 'en1'


REVISION HISTORY

  0.60      . SLINKCTL now displays the MAC address of the device

              the shell to redirect output to a file)
