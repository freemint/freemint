Welcome to Minixfs! If you are attemting to use Minixfs for the first time
then I would advise you read all the docs in this directory (except
syscall.doc). Otherwise you can just read latest.doc for features added to
the latest version and any bugfixes etc. (for more detailed info read the
'changes' file in the source distribution).

Here is a summary of the contents of the document files:

copying		Conditions of use.

address.doc	Contact addresses.

mfsdoc.doc	introduction to Minixfs and why you may or may not want to
		use it.

minit.doc	How to use 'minit' to create a Minixfs partition.

minixfs.doc	How to install Minixfs and about filename translation.

flist.doc	Description of flist utility.

csize.doc	Cache resizing utility.

fsck.doc	How to use fsck to fix filesystems and a bit of backround
		as to their structure.

mfsconf.doc	How to use mfsconf to set the filesystem translation modes.

mount.doc	How to use the mount program.

bugs.doc	How to submit a bug report.

syscall.doc	Minixfs specific system calls and special features of standard
		system calls. Only really of interest to programmers.

latest.doc	Bugfixes and/or features of this version.

NB Read the file bugs.doc before submitting a bug report. I don't have access
to your system so all I know about it is what you tell me, this file tells you
the kind of information I need to have a reasonable chance of fixing a problem.
I waste a great deal of time and money simply asking people to give me the
proper information after an initial report saying "Minixfs doesn't work" or
a nasty post to Usenet. In future I'll ingnore such reports, if you can't be
bothered to read the docs then I can't be bothered to help.
