The utility mfsconf is a very simple utility to set the filename translation
modes for a given device, or to inquire what they are.

To determine the file translation modes for a given drive (X: say) type: 
mfsconf X:
The output is self explanatory.

To set the modes the options -d -s -x or -c are used for directory search
execute or creation translation. The letter is followed by one of the
letters n, a, t or m for neither, all TOS or MiNT scopes respectively finally
the drive is specified.

E.g.

mfsconf -d n -s a X:
sets directory translation to none and search translation to all on drive X:
All other modes remain the same.
