        MINIX.XFS is the minix filesystem driver. To use it copy MINIX.XFS to
the root directory of whichever partition you start MiNT from. Reboot and
you should get the startup Minixfs message. Any Minixfs partitions should then
be immediately accessible.

	If you don't use MultiTOS then you should also copy nohog.acc into your
root directory (or wherever you load accessories from).

	There isn't a great deal more to say about it from a normal users point
of view. The only thing which can potentially cause trouble is filename 
translation.

        The system calls specific to Minixfs are described in syscall.doc.
These are only likely to interest programmers. 

FILENAME TRANSLATION

        Some programs cannot cope properly with mixed case filenames. In
general a program which is not MiNT aware (and some which are) will only
receive 13 chacacters of a filename. This is not the fault of Minixfs, in
pre-MiNT days there was simply no way to pass more characters to a program.
Some quite common (!) programs have problems, for example the desktop and
the standard file selector. As a result Minixfs has the option to translate
filenames to the standard TOS form, that is 8 characters with 3 character
extension and upper case (this will be referred to as 8+3 format).

        Naturally this translation is not ideal and some conflicts may occur.
The normal translation rule is to make the filename upper case and to retain
the original extension. For example FooBARFilename.C becomes FOOBARFI.C. The
basename and extension are cut back to 8 and 3 characters respectively as
would be expected. Periods are replaced by commas in all but the extension.

        There are four cases where translation can occur and 4 'scopes'. The
scope determines when a program should receive translation. The scopes are
all, MiNT domain, TOS domain and neither. Usually a program that understands
MiNT will run in MiNT domain; otherwise it will run in TOS domain. Clearly the 
'neither' scope means translation will never occur for that case and 'all'
means it will always occur.

        The 'cases' are search, directory, creation and executability.
When you attempt to access a file, 'search' is used. For example if the scope
means translations occurs for a specific program then if the file
FooBARFilename.C exists then it can be accessed as FOOBARFI.C. When a directory
is listed 'directory' translation is used, thus FooBARFilename.C will appear 
as FOOBARFI.C on e.g. the desktop.

        Creation is slightly different. This simply translates all filenames
created to lower case. So a TOS program creating FOOBARFI.C will actually
create foobarf.c . This can be useful for certain programs which translate
filenames to upper case.

        Executability refers to creating files as well, if a file is created
with the extensions ttp,gtp,tos,prg (either or mixed case) then the 'x' bit
in the filename is set automatically. This makes sure executable programs
stay executable. This is useful for utilities that copy files but are not
aware of MiNT's extensions.

        You can set the translation modes to different values for different
partitions, using the utility 'mfsconf'.
