NAME
     mount, umount - mount and unmount file systems

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/etc/mount [ -fnrv ] [ -t _t_y_p_e ] [ -o _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_-
     _t_e_m _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
     /usr/etc/umount [ -v ] _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m|_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  ...

DESCRIPTION
     mount attaches a named _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m to the file system hierar-
     chy  at  the pathname location _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, which must already
     exist.  If _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y has any contents  prior  to  the  mount
     operation,  these remain hidden until the _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m is once
     again   unmounted.    If   _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m   is   of   the   form
     _h_o_s_t:_p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e,  it is assumed to be an NFS file system (type
     nfs).

     umount unmounts a currently mounted file system,  which  can
     be specified either as a _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y or a _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.

     mount and umount maintain a table of mounted file systems in
     /etc/mtab,  described  in  fstab(5).   If invoked without an
     argument, mount displays the  contents  of  this  table.  

OPTIONS
  mount
     -f   Fake an /etc/mtab entry, but do not actually mount  any
          file systems.

     -n   Mount the  file  system  without  making  an  entry  in
          /etc/mtab.

     -v   Verbose.  Display a message indicating each file system
          being mounted.

     -r   Mount the specified file system read-only, even if  the
          entry  in /etc/fstab specifies that it is to be mounted
          read-write.

          Physically write-protected and magnetic-tape file  sys-
          tems  must be mounted read-only. Otherwise errors occur
          when the system attempts to update access  times,  even
          if no write operation is attempted.

     -o _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
          Specify file system _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, a comma-separated list  of
          words  from the list below.  Some options are valid for
          all file system types, while others apply to a specific
          type only.

          _o_p_t_i_o_n_s valid on _a_l_l file systems:

               rw|ro         Read/write or read-only.
               suid|nosuid   Setuid execution allowed  or  disal-
                             lowed.

               The default is `rw,suid'.

          _o_p_t_i_o_n_s specific to nfs (NFS) file systems:

               rsize=_n       Set the read buffer size to _n bytes.
               wsize=_n       Set  the  write  buffer  size  to  _n
                             bytes.
               timeo=_n       Set the NFS timeout to _n tenths of a
                             second.
               retrans=_n     The number of NFS retransmissions.
               port=_n        The server IP port number.
               acregmin=_n    Hold cached attributes for at  least
                             _n seconds after file modification.
               acregmax=_n    Hold cached attributes for  no  more
                             than  _n seconds after file modifica-
                             tion.
               acdirmin=_n    Hold cached attributes for at  least
                             _n seconds after directory update.
               acdirmax=_n    Hold cached attributes for  no  more
                             than   _n   seconds  after  directory
                             update.
               actimeo=_n     Set _m_i_n and _m_a_x  times  for  regular
                             files and directories to _n seconds.

               actimeo has no default; it sets  acregmin,  acreg-
               max, acdirmin and acdirmax

               Defaults for rsize and wsize are set internally by
               the system kernel.

  umount
     -v   Verbose.  Display a message indicating each file system
          being unmounted.

EXAMPLES
          To mount a remote file system:
               mount serv:/usr/src /usr/src
          To mount a remote file system read-only:
               mount -o ro serv:/usr/src /usr/src

FILES
     /etc/mtab           table of mounted file systems

SEE ALSO
     mkdir(2V),  open(2V),  fstab(5),  mtab(5),  automount(8), 
     mountd(8C), nfsd(8)

BUGS
     As for now, it is only possible to mount a remote file system in
     /nfs.
