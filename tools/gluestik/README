===================================

Feedback, bugreports, suggestions and any other constructive comment
is strongly recommended. Please send it as e-mail to me or the
MiNT mailinglist <freemint-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>.


Version 0.13
------------
- fixed bug in resolve; spurious crashes
  Thanks to Erik Hall who pointed it out

Version 0.12
------------
- complete rewrite of old GlueSTiK


Features:
---------
- allow the usage of STiK-API programs under MiNT-Net


Installation:
-------------

1. deinstallation of old GlueSTiK (if installed)
   - remove gluestik.xdd
   - remove gsresolv.prg and MiNT.CNF entry for autostart gsresolv.prg

2. copy gluestik.prg to your MultiTOS/MiNT folder and add
   "exec c:\multitos\gluestik.prg" to autostart new GlueSTiK driver
   
   NOTE: You can start GlueSTiK from desktop too. It's not neccessary
         to start it from MiNT.CNF!
         
         You can also end GlueSTiK. Simply send SIGTERM or SIGQUIT.
         The cookie will be removed too. But be sure nobody use it at this
         time.

3. Reboot


Bugs:
-----
- I heard LISTEN mode doesn't work correctly


Thanks:
-------
- to Scott Bigham for the previous GlueSTiK versions and the permission
  to rewrite it under the terms of the GPL
