This ROM is optimized for ARAnyM:
https://aranym.github.io/

emutos-aranym.img - Multilanguage

The following optional files are also supplied:
emucurs.rsc - modifiable mouse cursors for the AES/desktop
emucurs.def - definition file for the above
emuicon.rsc - contains additional icons for the desktop
emuicon.def - definition file for the above

Note that the emuicon.rsc file format differs from deskicon.rsc used by later
versions of the Atari TOS desktop.

The default language is English.
Other languages can be used by setting the NVRAM appropriately.

Alternatively, you can add the -k xx option on the ARAnyM command line
to force a specific language, where xx is:
cz - Czech
de - German
es - Spanish
fi - Finnish
fr - French
gr - Greek
it - Italian
no - Norwegian
ru - Russian (currently unsupported by ARAnyM)
se - Swedish
cd - Swiss German
us - English (US)
uk - English (UK)

The ARAnyM ROM features:
- optimization for 68040 CPU
- no ACSI support
- full NatFeat support (also enabled in the standard 512 KB version)

Note that selecting Norwegian/Swedish currently sets the language to English,
but the keyboard layout to Norwegian/Swedish.

This ROM image has been built using:
make aranym

This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using
