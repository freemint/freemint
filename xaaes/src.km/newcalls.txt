
   This text is NOT, that is _NOT_, official yet, as it is more a collection 
 of notes for myself to remember right now. Consider everything in this 
 textfile unusable/unimplemented unless clearly noted otherwise!

  Intention is that this file will contain documentation on new calls/things 
 added to XaAES. This file will also contain known differences between XaAES 
 and other AES's.

ToDo:

 . Fix mono drawing -> much better now
 . Fix PUSH menu-bar (and friends) -> done!
 . Add config to disable alerts
 . alt-ctrl-tab selects previous app

                            -= The N.AES cookie =-

 Because some programs insists on appl_control(), for example, instead of
checking with appl_getinfo(), XaAES now has an option to install a fake
'nAES' cookie. You enable this option by setting;

naes_cookie = yes

 in your xaaes.cnf.

 This fake cookie contains the following;

static N_AESINFO naes_cookie =
{
 0x0300,             /* version 3.0.0 */
 (25<<9)|(1<<5)|1,   /* 1 jan, 2005   */
 (1<<11)|(2<<5)|3,   /* 01:02:03      */
 0x8000,             /* Bit 15 set indicates that this really is XaAES */
 0L,
 0L,
};

 This structures element will never change under XaAES. Since N.AES does not
to be in development anymore, it is unlikely it will ever hit version 3.0.0.
Furthermore, if date and time is Jan 1st, 2005/01:02:03 together with bit
15 set in flags, one can safely assume this is the XaAES fake N.AES cookie.

 It is extremely strongly recommended that one does NOT check cookies at
all when determining function availability of any AES. The info above is more
of interest to authors of sysinfo software, etc., and must not be used for
anything else.

 appl_getinfo() is the correct call to use if the application wants to know
 which AES it runs under.

 INPUT:
  control[0]    130                              Opcode
  control[1]      1                              Elements in intin
  control[2]      5 (or 1 - extended appl_info)  Elements in intout
  control[3]      0 (or n - extended appl_info)  Elements in addrin
  control[4]      0                              Elements in addrout

  intin[0]        Mode

 OUTPUT:
  intout[0]       Return value - 0 = failure, 1 = success
  intout[1]       ap_gout1
  intout[2]       ap_gout2
  intout[3]       ap_gout3
  intout[4]       ap_gout4

 With extended appl_info, control[N_ADDRIN] and control[N_INTOUT] is consulted
 to determine what information should be returned based on 'Mode'. The meaning
 of the different extended parameters are documented for each extended 'Mode'.

 If control[N_INTOUT] have a value of 1, the normal ap_gout[1-4] elements are
 not used.

 If control[N_ADDRIN] have a value other than 0, then pointers are passed in
 addrin[0 .. N_ADDRIN], whose value depends on the 'Mode' being used.


 AES_WINDOW (11) - XaAES adds the following;

 'ap_gout1'     Bit  9 wind_get/set(WF_WHEEL)
                Bit 10 wind_get(WF_FIRSTAREAXYWH)
                Bit 11 wind_get/set(WF_OPTS)
                Bit 12 wind_get/set(WF_MENU)
		Bit 13 wind_get/set(WF_WORKXYWH)
		Bit 14 support wind_get(WF_CALCW2F/WF_CALCF2W) and WO0_WCOWORK
		       mode.

 AES_MESSAGES (12) - XaAES addes the following;

 'ap_gout1'     Bit 10 WM_REPOSED supported.

---------------------- Extended appl_info() modes --------------------------

 AES_VERSION (96)

 This is a new extended mode which will return detailed version information
 about the AES. When control[N_INTOUT] == 5, the following is filled into
 ap_gout[1-4];

  ap_gout1 = Major version number (decimal)
  ap_gout2 = Minor version number (decimal)
  ap_gout3 = Development Status (Beta, alpha, etc.)
  ap_gout4 = Target platform (m68k, etc.)
 
 'ap_gout1' &     Together, these two contain the decimal representation of
 'ap_gout2'       the AES's version number. For XaAES v0.992, 'ap_out1'
                  contains 0 (0x0000) and 'ap_out2' contains 992 (0x3e0).
 'ap_gout3'       This is a 16-bit integer where bits 0-7 (the low byte) is
                  a value indicating the development status of the AES,
                  see below (AES_DEVSTATUS_xxx) for meaning of different
                  values. Bits 8-15 are flags, see below (AES_FDEVSTATUS_xxx)
                  for current definitions.
 'ap_gout4'       This is a value indicating which platform the AES was built
                  for. See below (AES_ARCH_xxx) for meaning of different
                  values.

 When control[N_ADDRIN] == 4, the meaning of the pointers and what is filled
 is defined as follows;

  addrin[0]     'aes_id' pointer
  addrin[1]     'long_name' pointer
  addrin[2]     'info_string' pointer
  addrin[3]	reserved, set to NULL.
 
 'aes_id'       This is a character string with a fixed lenght of 8 bytes,
                into which the AES will write its unique AES ID.
                the AES ID is a right-aligned, space padded string, and can
                be considered to be the current AES's short name.
                For XaAES this string is filled with "   XaAES".

 'long_name'    This is a character buffer that the application must ensure
                can take up to 256 (255 + 0 termination) characters. The AES
                fills its long name description into this buffer. Lines in
                here are delimitted using CR (ascii 13). For XaAES, this
                buffer contains the following after the call;

                "XaAES Ain't the AES, a free MultiTasking AES for FreeMiNT"

 'info_string'  This is a character buffer that the application must ensure
                can take up to 256 (255 + 0 termination) characters. The AES
                fills this buffer with the following information where each
                element is delimitted by the "|" (ascii 0x7c) character.
                The string is constructed as follows;

                "asci version|development status|architecture target|
                 build date & time|compiler used",0

                Example string returned might be;
                "0.992|Alpha|m68k|Dec 17 2004 22:58:52|gcc 2.95.3",0
............................................................................
 
 AES_WOPTS (97)

 This mode will return a bitmask of available WF_OPTS settings. This bitmask
 is identical to that use by the actual wind_set/get(WF_OPTS).
 
 ap_gout1 = available window options 0 - see wind_set/get(WF_OPTS, wopt0)
 ap_gout2 = available window options 1 - see wind_set/get(WF_OPTS, wopt1)
 ap_gout3 = available window options 2 - see wind_set/get(WF_OPTS, wopt2)
 ap_gout4 = reserved - always cleared

 See wind_set/get() WF_OPTS mode for a detailed description of the bitmasks
 returned.
............................................................................
 AES_FUNCTIONS (98)

 This mode will return information about the existance of extended AES
 functions. Currently defined is;
 
 ap_gout1:

    bit 0 - AGI_WFORM
            If set, the following MagiC 5.10 introduced functions
            exists;
                 objc_wdraw()
                 objc_wchange()
                 objc_wedit()
                 graf_wwatchbox()
                 form_wbutton()
                 form_wkeybd()

    bit 1 - AGI_AOPTS
            If set, appl_options() exists.

    bits 2 - 15 Not yet defined, always reads 0.

 ap_gout2, ap_gout3 and ap_gout4:
    Not yet defined, all bits reads 0
............................................................................
 AES_AOPTS (99)
 
  This mode will return bitmasks of available application options.
  The bitmasks returned here are identical to the bitmasks used to modify
  the application options via appl_options(APL_OPTS). Needless to say, this option
  is not available if bit 0 in ap_gout1 is cleared after
  appl_getinfo(AES_FUNCTIONS).
  
  ap_gout1:
     bit 0:   AO0_OBJC_EDIT
              If set, extended slider management is available.
     bit 1:   AO0_WF_SLIDER
              If set, extended objc_edit() cursor management is present.
              See more info about this below.
     
     bits 2 - 15: Not yet defined, always set to 0.

 ap_gout2, ap_gout3, ap_gout4:
     No bits defined, always set to 0.

  index:
            The index of the resource one wants to work on.
  request:
            Specifies what kind of data one wants to get/set in the resource.
  wh:
            Window handle. If this is a positive number, it is interpreted as
            a handle of a window whose rectangle list is used when visual
            updates of the resource is necessary.
  p1 - p4:
            Four words whose meaning is dependant on request type.
  clip:
            Pointer to a struct GRECT containing a clipping rectangle which is
            used when visual updates of the resource is necessary.
  aout0 - aout3:
            Four long words whose meaning is dependant on request type.


 OBGET_TYPE
            Returns the object type in 'out1'.
            
===============================================================================
                       -= New window kind definitions =-

 XaAES now makes use of bit 15 in the 'kind' parameter of wind_create(). Setting
this bit will make XaAES allow for window border sizing without the SIZER gadget
being used.

#define BORDER  0x8000

 I hope this bit is not used for other purposes. This also means there is no
more free bits, and so future extensions will have to require an extended
wind_create() call. As of now, if control[1] has a value of 6 or more, XaAES
will pick up another 16-bits (short) of 'kind' bits from intin[5]. However,
no definitions are made yet.

===============================================================================

                            -= Shading windows =-

   XaAES now supports shading like N.AES and MagiC supports it, except from
 one important point; ALL window status'es remains across
 close_wind()/open_wind() calls, INCLUDING shaded. That means one should
 not rely on the fact that SHADED status will be cleared when one closes
 the window, like other AES's do. Instead, if you want to control SHADE
 status of a window, use the documented;

     wind_set(wh, WF_SHADE, mode, p2, p3, p4)

     'mode' selects wether to SHADE (mode = 1) or UNSHADE (mode = 0) the
     window in question. If 'mode' is -1 it toggle between SHADE and UNSHADE.
     p2, p3 and p4 are usused at the moment and must be set to 0.

===============================================================================

                    -= Window Coordinate Orientation WORK =-

  Normally, applications have had to cope with two defined areas in their
 handling of windows, namely the WORK area and the FULL area. XaAES now offers
 a new operating mode in which applications only work with one of the defined
 window areas, the WORK area. The benefits of this, seen from application side,
 are;
 
  1. No need for wind_calc() anymore.
  
  2. No need to convert window coordinates carried by WM_SIZED/WM_MOVED/
     WM_REPOSE, etc, to WORK coordinates. before doing modifications, like
     snapping, before converting back to FULL for wind_set(WF_CURRXYWH).

  Benefits seen from the AES side;

  1. AES is free to modify the size of window borders without notifying
     the application, unless the WORK area changes in which case a WM_REPOSED
     or WM_SIZED is sent.

     
  The following changes happen when this mode is used;

  1. wind_set(WF_CURRXYWH/WF_WORKXYWH) become the same call.
  
  2. wind_calc() will always return the same coordinates it is passed.
     In other words, AES does not distinquish between BORDER and FULL
     areas. For application that does not do gymnastics to place own
     toolbars, etc., this makes the new mode work without any changes
     to the application.

  3. All AES messages carrying window coordinates will carry WORK area
     coordinates only.
  
  4. All wind_get/set() calls (except WF_CALCx2x calls, see below) will
     accept WORK area window coordinates only.
  
  5. For applications that need to know the FULL extent of windows
     (for example to cascade windows, or position one window next to
     another), there is wind_get(WF_CALCW2F) and wind_get(WF_CALCF2W). See
     below for documentation.

 Creating a window
 
  Creating a window under normal conditions looked something like this;
  
   wind_get(dth, WF_WORKXYWH, &full_x, &full_y, &full_w, &full_h);
   wind_calc(WC_WORK, max_x, max_y, max_w, max_h, &w_x, &w_y, &w_w, &w_h);
   if (snapping)
   {
   	snap(work_coords);

=                                   and                                       =

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  wind_xset() differs from wind_set() in that wind_xset() returns an additional
 4 values compared to wind_set(). The XaAES differentiate between the two by
 looking at the third element of the control array which indicates the size
 of the intout array.

 short wind_set(short handle, short mode,
                short p1, short p2, short p3, short p4);
 {
 	intin[0] = handle;
 	intin[1] = mode;
 	intin[2] = p1;
 	intin[3] = p2;
 	intin[4] = p3;
 	intin[5] = p4;
 }

 GEM arrays as follows:

	Address     Element    meaning

        control    control[0]   105        # Opcode

        control+4  control[2]   1 (or 5)   # Entries in intout (wind_xset())
        control+6  control[3]   0          # Entries in addrin

        intin+10   intin[5]    p4
        intout     intout[0]   Return value (1 = OK, 0 = error)

      Additional output when wind_xset() is used as follows - 
      XaAES checks control[2] to see if wind_xset()
      is used:

        intout+2   intout[1]
        intout+4   intout[2]
        intout+6   intout[3]
        intout+8   intout[4]

 XaAES wind_set() extensions;
...............................................................................
  wind_set(handle, WF_CURRXYWH, x, y, w, h);
 wind_xset(handle, WF_CURRXYWH, x, y, w, h);

   Compatible with all other AES's, except from the following points;

   1. If x, y, w and h all have a value of -1, XaAES ignores the call,
      but fills in any return values when needed (see below).
   2. x and y values of -1 are 'legal', i.e, one cannot use -1 to use
      any old x value. Ofcourse, x and y coordinates are checked to be
      inside the rootwindow (not X when noleft = false).
   3. When h have a value of 0, the window is infact shaded. This is a thing
      N.AES does with MiNTSetter, altho I'm not sure this is correct.
      The application is sent a WM_SHADED. On the next
      wind_set(handle, WF_CURRXYWH,...) where the h coordinate is not equal
      to the window's shaded height, the window is unshaded. While the
      window is shaded via this method, shift-clicks on the window title to 
      shade a window is ignored.

   wind_xset() output:
   1. XaAES returns the CURRXYWH of the new position the window was moved to,
      removing the need for a wind_get(handle, WF_CURRXYWH,...) call.

  Note: wind_set(handle, WF_CURRXYWH, -1, -1, -1, -1); will return exactly
        the same as wind_get(handle, WF_CURRXYWH);
...............................................................................
  wind_set(handle, WF_PREVXYWH, x, y, w, h);
 wind_xset(handle, WF_PREVXYWH, x, y, w, h);

   If either x, y, w or h have a value of -1, that coordinate is not changed.
   If ALL coordinates have a value of -1, the window is actually moved to the
   current PREVXYWH coordinates, making the current window position the new
   PREVXYWH position.

   wind_xset() output:
     1. XaAES returns the resulting PREVXYWH, which the window will be moved to
        on the next use of the FULLED gadget or...
     2. When all coordinates passed have a value of -1, XaAES return the
        CURRXYWH of the new position the window was moved to, removing the
        need for a wind_get(handle, WF_CURRXYWH,...) call.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 wind_set(handle, WF_FULLXYWH, x, y, w, h);
 wind_xset(handle, WF_FULLXYWH, x, y, w, h);

   If either x, y, w or h have a value of -1, that coordinate is not changed.
   If ALL coordinates have a value of -1, the window is actually moved to the
   current FULLXYWH coordinates, making the current window position the new
   PREVXYWH position.

   wind_xset() output:
     1. XaAES returns the resulting FULLXYWH, which the window will be moved to
        on the next use of the FULLED gadget or...
     2. When all coordinates passed have a value of -1, XaAES return the
        CURRXYWH of the new position the window was moved to, removing the
        need for a wind_get(handle, WF_CURRXYWH,...) call.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 wind_set(handle, WF_OPTS, mode, wopt0, wopt1, wopt2);

 'handle'     is window handle or -1. If handle is a legal window handle,
              the options will only apply to that window. If 'handle' is
              -1, the settings will apply to all windows the application
              creates AFTER this call.

 'mode'       is 0 to clear the selected bits or 1 to set the selected bits.

 'wopt0'      Currently available options are as follows;

           #define WO0_WHEEL           0x0001
              Setting this bit will enable extended mouse wheel support, and
              go into WHL_AROWWHEEL mode causing XaAES to send extended
              WM_ARROWED messages to the application when the mouse wheel turns.
              Read section "XaAES and wheel mouse handling." for details.

           #define WO0_FULLREDRAW      0x0002
              Setting this bit will make XaAES send WM_REDRAW messages to cover
              the whole work-area of the window when it is FULLED. Default
              behaviour is to only send WM_REDRAW messages for the areas that
              need it, blitting the already visible parts. This can also be
              configured via xaaes.cnf, see the app_options argument 'naesff'.

           #define WO0_NOBLITW         0x0004
              Setting this bit will make XaAES send WM_REDRAW messages to cover
              the whole work-area of the window when its WIDTH changes. This is
              handy for apps like HighWire, Textprocessors ,etc, that need to
              reformat when window width changes. Default behaviour is to send
              WM_REDRAW messages for the areas that need it.

           #define WO0_NOBLITH         0x0008
              Setting this bit will make XaAES send WM_REDRAW messages to cover
              the whole work-area of the window when its HEIGHT changes.
              Default behaviour is to send WM_REDRAW messages for the areas
              that need it.

           #define WO0_SENDREPOS       0x0010
              Setting this bit will make XaAES send a WM_REPOSED(38) message
              when a windows X/WIDTH and/or Y/HEIGHT coordinate pair changes.
              Such changes happes when the user resizes the window using
              upper/left borders. Default behaviour is to first send a WM_MOVED
              followed by a WM_SIZED message under these conditions, because
              older apps dont evaluate the WIDTH/HEIGHT in WM_MOVED messages.
              So, dudes, set this bit and use WM_REPOSED! :)

           #define WO0_WCOWORK         0x0020
              Setting this bit will enable Window Coordinate Orientation WORK
              mode. See above for more info.

=                        wind_xget(), wind_get() extension                    =
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   wind_xget is an extension that was first seen in MyAES via the
 wind_xget(WF_FIRSTAREAXYWH) function. The big difference between wind_get()
 and this new wind_xget() is that wind_xget() accepts 4 more input values than
 wind_get(). The AES looks at the second control element, which indicates the
 size of the intout array, to differentiate between the two.


 short wind_xget(short handle, short mode,
                short p1, short p2, short p3, short p4);
 {
 	intin[0] = handle;
 	intin[1] = mode;
 	intin[2] = p1;
 	intin[3] = p2;
 	intin[4] = p3;
 	intin[5] = p4;
 }

 GEM arrays as follows:

	Address     Element    meaning 
        ------------------------------------------------------
        control    control[0]   104        # Opcode
        control+2  control[1]   6          # Entries in intin
        control+4  control[2]   5          # Entries in intout
        control+6  control[3]   0          # Entries in addrin 
        control+8  control[4]   0          # entries in addrout 
        intin      intin[0]    handle

        intin+10   intin[5]    p4
        intout     intout[0]   Return value (1 = OK, 0 = error)

      XaAES uses the following extra output elements if control[2]
      indicates the application wants it:

        intout+2   intout[1]
        intout+4   intout[2]
        intout+6   intout[3]
        intout+8   intout[4]



 XaAES wind_set() extensions;

...............................................................................
 wind_xget(handle, WF_FIRSTAREAXYWH, x, y, w, h);

    This function will generate a rectangle list of a window portion, whose
   coordinates are found in x, y, w and h. If, for example, one have an
   animated icon that is updated reqularly, this function will generate a
   rectangle list only for the area in which the icon resides.
   wind_get(WF_NEXTXYWH) will get the next rectangle of the desired area
   (if any).

 Usage:
  wind_xget(handle, WF_FIRSTAREAXYWH, x, y, w, h); Get first rectangle of area
  wind_get(handle, WF_NEXTXYWH);                   Get next  rectangle of area

...............................................................................
 wind_xget(handle, WF_CALCW2F, x, y, w, h);
 wind_xget(handle, WF_CALCF2W, x, y, w, h);

   The intention of these two wind_xget() modes is to replace wind_calc() for
   existing windows. wind_calc() does not have a window context, and thus its
   calculations is based on current theme. The current theme may change, which
   renders wind_calc() output useless for applications that need access to
   window geometrics of windows not created by itself, like virtual desktop
   managers, window cascaders, etc. For applications that want to support
   dynamic theme changes, wind_calc() should be depreciated. Discussion is
   going on wheter or not this is "needed", but a combination of XaAES's
   WCOWORK mode (see wind_set(WF_WCOWORK) above) and these functions lift
   any restrictions.
 
  WF_CALCW2F: This mode will take an arbitrary WORK area, and return the
              resulting FULL area of the window in question.
  
  WF_CALCF2W: This mode will take an arbitrary FULL area, and return the
              corresponding WORK area.

===============================================================================
                       XaAES and wheel mouse handling.

  This has changed a little compared to the original documentation and
 implementation. When the wheel is on a window whose owner dont know about
 mouse wheels at all, normal WM_ARROWED messages are sent, regardless wether
 the window has ARROW gadgets or not.
  There is no extra info added to these messages in this case, as it were in
 the original implementation.

  Currently mouse wheel events are sent to the owner of the window underneath
 the mouse pointer in all cases except when owner of mouse_lock() is waiting
 for MU_WHEEL.

  For programmers who want to take advantage of mouse wheels in a better way,
 here's an overview;

  wind_set(handle, WF_WHEEL, mode, wheel_mode, 0, 0);

  handle      Window handle, or -1 if one wants settings to apply to all windows
              created hereafter by the application.
  
  mode        0 = Turn extended wheel awareness off, 1 = Turn on.
  
  wheel_mode
           WHL_REALWHEEL ( 0 )
              When wheel_mode is set to 0 (XWHL_REALWHEEL), XaAES will send
              real wheel messages, constructed as follows;

              msg[0] = WM_WHEEL ( 345 )
              msg[1] = ID of sender
              msg[2] = ...
              msg[3] = window handle
              msg[4] = Mouse X
              msg[5] = Mouse Y
              msg[6] = keyboard shift status
              msg[7] = Wheel info
  
              'wheel info' consists of the following data;
              bits 0-7    - Wheel amount
              bits 8-11   - orient
              bits 12-15  - Wheel ID
 
              'orient' is a bitmask where bit 0 indicates direction, and
              bit 1 indicates orientation;

               bit 0  -  0 = up or left
                         1 = down or right
               bit 1  -  0 = vertical (bit 0 indicates UP/DOWN)
                         1 = horizontal (bit 0 indicates LEFT/RIGHT)

              'wheel ID' contains the wheel number. 0 is wheel #1, etc..
              'wheel amount' holds the number of wheel-turns.
      
           WHL_AROWWHEEL ( 1 ) This is the default wheel_mode set if the
              value passed is outside the available range. When this mode is
              selected, extended WM_ARROWED messages are sent upon each wheel
              turn. With this mode, only one WM_ARROWED message is send if
              configured to scroll more than one line per wheel turn. This
              means the application must check, and scroll the appropriate
              number of lines indicated by bits 8-15 in msg[4];
              
              msg[0] = WM_ARROWED
              ...
              msg[4] = Extended, see below.
              msg[5] = Mouse X
              msg[6] = Mouse Y
              msg[7] = keyboard shift status

              There is extended info in msg[4] with this mode, layed out as
              follows;
                       bits 0-3 -  WA_xxx (same as in the original WM_ARROWED
                                   messages, a value between 0 and 7, extended
                                   modes up to 15)
                                   bits 4-7 -  unused.
                       bits 8-15 - Number of lines to scroll (unsigned byte)
     
                     This makes it possible for wheel aware applications to
                     scroll the required amount instantly, wihtout receiveing
                     more than this one extended WM_ARROWED.

           WHL_SLDRWHEEL ( 2 )
              When wheel_mode is set to 2 (XHWL_SLDRWHEEL), XaAES converts
              wheel turns into slider movements. XaAES sends standard
              WM_VSLID/WM_HSLID messages reflecting the wheel turns.
              For this to work, WF_VSLIDE/WF_HSLIDE wind_get/set() modes have
              been extended. When the application gets the WM_xSLIDE message,
              it must pass back the position from the message unmodified
              together with your modified position;

              wind_set(handle, WF_[V,H]SLIDE, postion, unmodified, 0, 0);

              Even if the application snaps slider movements and finds that
              the slider does not move, it has to pass back the unmodified
              slider position via wind_set(). In cases where the original
              slider position match the prevsiously set position, XaAES does
              not set or redraw the slider. But it needs to collect the 'real'
              position of the slider for wheel -> slider calculations to work.

 XaAES now implements good keyboard navigation in dialogs when applications
correctly use the form_keybd() and form_button() functions to implement their
own non-modal form_do() function.

 It is strongly adviced that application authors follow the gudelines that
follow here!

 XaAES's keyboard navigation depends on correct usage of the following
functions;

 form_keybd();
 form_button();
 objc_edit();

 form_keybd()   - processes keys application receives via evnt_multi() or
                  evnt_keybd().
 form_button()  - processes mouse clicks on objects.
 objc_edit()    - XaAES needs to know where the cursor is, so it is vital
                  that objc_edit() is used correct. If XaAES doesnt have
                  correct info about where the cursor is, you will get redraw
                  problems regarding the cursor.

INPUT:
 editfocus:  This is the object which currently has editfocus. If editfocus is
             set to 0, or if the object passed is not editable, XaAES will try
             look for the first instance of an editable in the given tree. If
             one is found, it is returned in 'newobj' unless 'keycode'
             triggered selection of an 'exit' object.
 
 keycode:    The keycode one received from evnt_multi() or evnt_keybd().
             See above for an overview of the keys XaAES uses for keyboard
             navigation.
 
 nextobj:    A lot of confusion around this parameter, it seems.
             In some documentation this is said to be reserved, or unused, yet
             other say you should put the same value here as you do in
             'editfocus'. Some documentation tells you it should contain 0, yet
             other say it should contain 1. What a mess this is!
             
             Here is what I think is correct;
             
             If a 1 is returned in 'cont', and the key is passed back in
             'keyout', the value passed to the function in 'nextobj' is
             returned in 'newobj'. In original Atari documentation it is said
             that one should place the same value (current edit focus) in both
             'editfocus' and 'nextobj'. This is infact recommended, because
             then it becomes very easy to check for a change of editfocus.
             This because form_keybd() returns a new editfocus when changed
             or the value in 'editfocus' when 'keyout' is 0.
             If 'keyout' is nonzero to indicate key wasnt used, the
             value in 'nextobj' is returned in 'newobj' if no new editfocus.
             In both cases one will get the same return in 'newobj' if edit-
             focus didnt change when giving identical values to 'editfocus'
             and 'nextobj'.
             
             This means that 'nextobj' is NOT a reserved value. It has a
             purpose, and that the Atari documentation is found to be correct
             where all others were wrong!

 tree:       'tree' contains the address of the object tree on which
             form_keybd() should act.
OUTPUT:
 cont:   0 - is returned if the key triggered a selection of an object
             that is 'exitable'. That is, if object has OF_EXIT or
             OF_TOUCHEXIT set. When this happens, 'newobj' contains the object
             index of the selected object. A 0 is also returned in 'keyout'
             to indicate that the key was used by form_keybd().
             
             NOTE:
                If you use objects that has both OF_EDITABLE and OF_EXIT or
                OF_TOUCHEXIT flag bits set, you need to manually check if the
                object returned in 'newobj' is an editable one, and change
                editfocus accordingly. See example code below.

         1 - is returned if the key triggered a selection of an object that
             is not 'exitable', or if the key was not used by form_keybd().
             If there was a selection done, a 0 is returned in 'keyout' to
             indicate the key was used and 'newobj' contains the index of the
             object which should get editfocus. If editfocus did not change,
             then the value passed in 'editfocus' is returned in 'newobj'.
             
             If a nonzero value is returned in 'keyout', the key was not used
             by form_keybd() and 'newobj' normally contains the value passed
             in 'nextobj' if editfocus didnt change or, at least under XaAES,
             the index of the new object which should gain editfocus.
	     
             NOTE: Under XaAES it is possible that editfocus changes AND the
             key is returned! This means that when the key passed to
	     form_keybd() is returned in 'keyout', one should always check
	     'newobj', and if not equal to 'nextobj', set editfocus to
	     'newobj' BEFORE passing the key to objc_edit().
	     
 newobj:    If an object was selected by the function and it has OF_EXIT or
            OF_TOUCHEXIT obflags set, 'newobj' contains the index of the
            'exit' object and return value is 0 to indicate this.
	    
            If form_keybd() returns 1, 'newobj' contain the object index of the
            editable object which should get editfocus if it changed. If edit-
            focus didn not change, the value passed in 'nextobj' is returned
            in 'nextobj' to indicate this. If the tree does not have any editable
            objects, 'newobj' will contain -1 upon function return.

 keyout:    If the key was used by the function, 'keyout' will contain 0 upon
            function return. Else the key is returned in 'keyout', and can be
            passed to objc_edit().

 Comments:  The value returned in 'newobj' changes according to these different
            situations;
            
            cont = form_keybd(tree, editfocus, keycode, nextobj, &newobj, &keyout);
            
            If cont == 0 - object with OF_EXIT or OF_TOUCHEXIT selected;
               'newobj' contains the object index of the object selected.
               'keyout' contains 0 to indicate key was used.
            
            If cont == 1 - non-exit object selected.
               if 'keyout' == 0 - key used
                  'newobj' contains the new editfocus, or the value passed in
                           'editfocus' if editfocus didnt change.
               
               if 'keyout' != 0 - key not used.
                  'newobj' contains the value passed to function in 'nextobj'.
                           Under XaAES: contains the value passed to function
                                        in 'nextobj' or new editfocus if this
                                        changed. Typically happens if the value
                                        passed in 'editfocus' is not a valid
                                        editable object, in which case XaAES
                                        searches for the first visible editable
                                        in the tree and suggests this to be the
                                        new editfocus.
