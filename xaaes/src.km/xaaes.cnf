# video = 0x801a  will select 16 colour VGA mode in
#                 the resolution preset by centscreen.
# Note: 
# When you use a screenexpander like Screenblaster, you have to use
# the video option as well. This will make the Screenblaster-Software
# to show up the resolution-selection-menu.
#

#
# naes_cookie = <bool>          (default is 'no')
#
# Some applications need to think they are running under N.AES, and
# don't use appl_getinfo() to check for function availability. This
# is terrible programming, and to all programmers feeling targeted;
# Fix your apps! XaAES can now provide a fake nAES cookie, so that
# more applicaitons will run correctly on XaAES, but there is also
# another terrible danger; Some N.AES calls return pointers to
# internal AES structures, which is kinda putting your testicles
# into the hand of a stranger and hope he is a friend. Such apps will
# definately crash when run on XaAES while thinking its on N.AES.
# Older versions of Taskbar work much better with naes_cookie = yes.
#
# See more info about this in newcalls.txt, it is possible to detect
# that the cookie is a fake one (and thus really the AES is XaAES).
#
#naes_cookie = yes

#
# Mouse packet time-gap. This is the time (in 200hz timer ticks) that
# must pass after a button-release event before a new button-press
# event is accepted by moose.adi. Because of unstable mouse-buttons,
# a button-press may follow immediately after a button-release, creating
# and "extra" mouse-click. This is especially annoying when releasing
# the right-button after a drag-session (Thing's directory-window, for
# example), and the "extra-click" fires some unwanted action.
#
#mp_timegap (default is 3)

#
# lrmb_swap = <bool>            (default is 'no')
#
# Swap left and right mouse buttons. Setting 'lrmb_swap = yes' will make
# XaAES swap the left and right mouse buttons.
#
#lrmb_swap = yes

#
# Mouse wheel configuration.
#
# There are currently four configuration variables that is used to to set
# wheel configuration;
#
# vertical_wheel_id = <value>      (default is 0)
# vertical_wheel_amount = <value>  (default = 1)
# horizontal_wheel_id = <value>    (default is 1)
# horizontal_wheel_amount <value>  (default is 1)
#
# With 'vertical_wheel_id' you can choose which wheel you want to use as the
# vertical wheel. Likewise, you set the ID of the wheel you want to define as
# the horizontal wheel. Do NOT set the same value for both vertical and
# horizontal wheel ID's.
#
# With vertical_wheel_amount you can set the amount of lines to scroll per
# turn of the vertical wheel. Likewise, you can set the amount of columns to
# to scroll per turn of the horizontal wheel using 'horizontal_wheel_amount'.
# The value for these configuration variables must be a number between
# 1 and 20. Per now, this actually sets the number of WM_ARROWED messages
# send to the application per turn of the wheel.
#
#vertical_wheel_id = 0
#vertical_wheel_amount = 3
#horizontal_wheel_id = 1
#horizontal_wheel_amount = 3

#
# redraw_timeout. This is the time in ms XaAES will wait for clients to
# service WM_REDRAW messages between actions that generate redraws,
# like moving/closing/opening/etc. windows. If a client is busy and this
# 'times out'happens, it is marked as lagging and XaAES will service the
# redraws for it. When this happens, XaAES just draws the areas not
# serviced with dark gray color until the client re-enters evnt_multi().
# For slow machines, this timeout must be higher (longer) than on faster
# machines.
#
# redraw_timeout (default is 500)

# 
#
# menu = pull or push or leave + optional nolocking
# default is 
#
menu = leave

#
# popscroll - number of lines of a popup above which it will be made scrollable
#
#popscroll = 0

#
# menupop_pids = <bool>         (default = 'no')
#
# Setting menupop_pids = yes makes XaAES list its clients in the client-list-
# menupopup using the following format;
#
# "  PPID(RPPID) -> PID Client nice name"
#
# where 'PPID' is the physical parent-pid of the Client (which is the AESSYS).
# 'RPPID' is the Process ID of the process that called shel_write() to start
# it, it is the "Real Parent PID". 'PID' is the Process ID of the client.
#
# If set to 'no' (the default), only the client's nice name (when available,
# else its 'proc_name') is listed.
#
#menupop_pids = yes

#
# popup_timeout - Time in milliseconds before popups opens.  (default = 10)
# popout_timeout - Time in millisecods before popups close.  (default = 1000)
#
# With these two configuration variables you can configure menu/popup
# navigation to your liking. 'popup_timeout' sets the time in ms XaAES's
# menu/popup navigation waits before brining up the attachment for a given
# entry when mouse hovers over. 'popout_timeout' sets the time in ms before
# an entry's attachement is closed when mouse leaves, unless mouse enters
# another entry with an attachement in which case that new attachment is
# opened according to 'popup_timeout". 
#
# In normal AES menu/popup navigation it is possible to click, and select,
# a menu or pop entry that has an attachment. However, to be able to implement
# decent navigation, XaAES behaves slightly different from other AES's now;
#
# Single click entry without attachment - select it, like normal AES
# single click entry with attachment    - open it immediately,
#                                         like on most other GUIs
# Double click entry with attachment    - select it, like single-click on
#                                         normal AES
#
#
#popup_timeout = 100

#
# toppage = bold or faint
#
#toppage = faint

#
# alert_windows = <value>            (default is 0xffff)
#
# THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT DEFINATE AND ONLY PARTIAL AS OF NOW!!!
#
# alert_window is a bitmask indicating which alerts coming via the
# alert pipe will be shown in a window. The idea is that this mask
# is used to tell the AES which alerts you want like this;
#  bit 0 set -> show alerts with no icon
#  bit 1 set -> show alerts with INFO icon
#  bit 2 set -> show alerts with QUESTION icon
#  bit 3 set -> show alerts with STOP icon
#  etc., etc.
#
# Because there is no consideration as to which icon is used
# (for example, kernel's PROCESS KILLED alerts have icon #1, the same
# as used for other warnings/informative ALERTS), the implemention
# is not complete. So for now use this to either turn off or on alerts
# altogether. To turn on alert windows, use a mask where all bits are set,
# 0xffff, and to turn off clear all bits, 0x0000
#
#alert_windows = 0xffff

#
# next_active = 'client' or 'window' (default is 'window')
#
# Selects wether the previous active application or
# the owner of the previous topped (or only) window
# should be set active upon client termination.
# next_active = client

#-
#- close_lastwind = 'client' or 'window' (default is 'window')
#-
#- Selects what to do when the last window of a client is closed.
#-
#-   Setting to 'client' will keep the application whose
#-   last window is closed as the top application. This prevents
#-   XaAES from putting infront another application when the last
#-   window of the application currently infront is closed.
#-
#-   Setting to 'window' will make XaAES put the application
#-   who owns the foremost window infront, making it active.
#-   This is the normal behaviour done by other AES's we thinks.
#-
#- close_lastwind = client

#
# app_options = appname,option1,option2,...
#
# This will let you configure application specific things.
# There are two special appname's you can use, one is 'default'
# and the other is 'aessys'. 'default' is used to set GLOBAL
# configuration which affects all applications. A 'default'
# configuration have to be specified first.
# With appname being 'aessys', you can specify configuration
# for the aessys's windows, like taskmanager, etc.
# All other appname's are considered to be individual applications,
# and settings for 'autos401' will only affect that one application
# whose filename is autos401.[prg,app,gtp] or whose nicename is
# autos401. "autos401" is Autosort v4.1, btw.
#
# Here's a quick overview of the currently available configuration
# options, default settings mentioned goes for both aessys and the
# default values each application will use until changed;
#
# A <bool> value can be 'true','false','on','off','yes','no',
# '1' and '02
#
# A <value> must be a decimal value (for now).
# 
# windowner = <bool>      default: false
#     Will make XaAES show the name of the application
#     owning the window in the window's title.
#
# nohide = <bool>         default: false
#     Windows will not have the HIDE widget, and thus cannot be
#     hidden.
#
# xa_nohide = <bool>      default: true
#     Windows containing form_do() sessions will not have
#     the HIDE widget and thus not be hidable.
#     Autosort is one application that cannot have its
#     form_do() session hidden (or moved)
#
# xa_nomove = <bool>      default: true
#     Windows containing a form_do() session will not be
#     moveable. Autosort is one such application.
#
# noleft = <bool>         default: false
#     Windows can not be moved offscreen to the left.
#
# thinwork = <bool>       default: false
#     The "inner" 3d-effect is disabled. This 3d-effect 'frames'
#     the work-area of windows in a 3d-ish frame.
#
# nolive = <bool>         default: false
#     Disable live window move/resize/etc.
#
# winframe_size = <value>  default: 1
#     Set the size of window frame. A value of -1 sets
#     "overscan windows", which contains no frame or shadowing.
#     It is not recommended to set a value of -1 yet!.
#     A value of 0 will make windows without any borders.
#     positive values make window-frames larger.
#
# naesff = <bool>         default: false
#     N.AES Full Fix;
#     When naesff is set true, XaAES will send full WM_REDRAW
#     message when all four window coordinates change, which
#     happens when windows are FULLEd. This will fix redraw
#     problems with apps like Jinnee.
#
# inhibit_hide = <bool>   default: false
#     Setting this will prevent it from being hidden by XaAES, which
#     is very handy for applications like Taskbar, etc, that one
#     regards like "system apps".
#
# clwtna = <bool>         default: true
# (Close Last Window Tops Next App)
#     Selects what to do when the last window of a client is closed.
#     Setting to 'false' will keep the application whose
#     last window is closed as the top application. This prevents
#     XaAES from putting infront another application when the last
#     window of the application currently infront is closed.
#     Setting to 'true' will make XaAES put the application
#     who owns the foremost window infront, making it active.
#     This is the normal behaviour done by other AES's we thinks.
#
#
#
# This default setting will make XaAES look closer to n.aes, but
# will require precision when grabbing the window border for
# resizing :)
#
#app_options = default, thinwork = true, winframe_size = 1
#
# This default setting will make XaAES look like it has been
# looking up to now;
#
#app_options = default, thinwork = false, winframe_size = 2
#
# This setting for autosort401 will make sure its window cannot be
# moved.
#
#app_options = autos401, xa_nomove = true
#
# Ataricq looks much better when the "inner" 3d effect is turned off
# with 'thinwork" and as small a windowframe as possible.
#
#app_options = ataricq, thinwork = true, winframe_size = 1
#
# Taskbar needs this to prevent it from being hidden, and it closing
# its only window should always top the previously topped app.
#
#app_options = taskbar, inhibit_hide = yes, clwtna = yes

#
# ctlalta_survivors = <list of app-names>
#
# 'app-names' is the filename part of the program file, padded with
# spaces to fit 8 characters. This is NOT the 'nice' name. So, if your
# Toswin2 binary is named "tw2.app", you use "tw2     ". Each app-name
# is separated with comma.
#
# This will allow you to specify which applications XaAES does not
# attempt to terminate when user presses CTRL-ALT-A to quit all
# applications. Normally, this keycombo quits all running applications
# leaving only XaAES. However, most of the time, keeping certain
# applications running is preferred, such as the desktop, the taskbar,
# av-server application, etc, etc.
#
# One special name is '_aes_shell_', which will prevent XaAES from
# terminating the desktop loaded via "shell = " configuration variable.
# One can still use the name of the desktop program if it is konwn, but
# an easier way is to use '_aes_shell_', as that will work without
# further configuration modifications when one changes desktop from, say,
# Thing to Jinnee.
#
# If you want to bypass this setting, and quit ALL applications, leaving
# only XaAES, you can press ctrl-alt-shift-a.
