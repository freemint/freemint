MOOSE.XDD
============

 XaAES depends on moose.xdd to get mouse button and movement events. 
 Moose.xdd installs /dev/moose and /dev/mooses files. XaAES waits for 
 button/movement events (using Fselect()) on /dev/moose, while /dev/mooses 
 is intended to be used instead of vq_mouse(); VDI call.

 Mouse wheel support NOT TESTED! You must define HAVE_WHEEL to compile with 
 wheel support.

 USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! THERE'S NO WARRANTY!

 Have fun,
 Odd Skancke <ozk@atari.org>
