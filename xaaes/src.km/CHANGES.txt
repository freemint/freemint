 Resource files:

  As a result of separating the window-renderer and
AES-renderer from the main AES kernel, turning them into
modules, the following changes is needed before you run
current CVS XaAES;

  The icons for extended AES objects have been taken out of
the widget resource and put into a new resource, called
'xa_xtobj.rsc'. These objects belong to the AES object
renderer, and not the window renderer.

  Altho one can still use 'widgets' keyword in xaaes.cnf to
select which widgets resource, this is a thing that will
be removed from xaaes.cnf later on. This is a configuration
that belongs to the window renderer module.

  For the extended AES objects, the AES object renderer
looks for 'xa_xtobj.rsc'. There is no configuration to
select another filename, so for now one needs to copy the
file one wants to use and rename it 'xa_xtobj.rsc'. This
is a configuration that belongs to the AES object renderer.


 For a successful setup, these files need to be present in
<sysdir>/xaaes;

 xaaes.rsc
 xaaeswdg.rsc
 xa_xtobj.rsc <- added.

 Be sure you always use the latest resources from the CVS!
 
 Because of these changes, a collection of widget resources
was added to the CVS. Widget resources is found in
src.km/widgets, and in src.km/xobj one can find different
AES extended object files.
