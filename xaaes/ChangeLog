- xa_fsel.c: default action for fileselector added. Should fix the problem
  with unclosable "Launch desktop" entry in XaAES system menu.
- xa_scl.c: large cleanup! :)

- XaAES 0.963 source code imported to CVS server
- *.s (assembler) files renamed to *.S in the hope that GCC will eat
  these files one day
- all source and text files converted from CRLF to LF. Only PureC project
  files (*.prj) stay in CRLF to not break the compilation
- added history_[79].txt to CVS and renamed them to ChangeLog.{Craig|Henk}
- created this new ChangeLog and a simple README file
