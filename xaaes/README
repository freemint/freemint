This is XaAES - a multitasking AES written from scratch by Craig Graham
and released under the GPL. Several other people contributed to this
project since the 1995, most notably Henk Robbers who has been developing
XaAES since 1999. You can find detailed info in the ChangeLogs.


This version compile now with gcc. I have removed all unnecessary
stuff especially from the header files. Uptodate AES/VDI bindings
are in the gemlib library.

Other important changes:
- NEEDS NEW MOOSE.XDD DRIVER!!! Compile and use the one in
  ../sys/xdd/whlmoose/
- use nkcc routines from cflib (available for PureC/gcc)
- use VDI bindings from current gemlib (available for PureC/gcc)
- use libkern support library from FreeMiNT;
  don't depend on any other library now
- removed all unnnecessary assembler things
