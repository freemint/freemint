COPYING CONDITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a little complicated. First of all, I hope all things are
handled correctly. I don't want to bother anyone and I don't want
to break any copyright terms. If you think I made a mistake, please
contact me.

The source code of the FreeMiNT CVS repository is based on several
different packages with different copying terms. I spent a lot of
time lately doing the same things on every package I updated over
and over again. Furthermore, large parts of the code were identical
in some of the packages. So my main goal was to get rid of such
time consuming jobs, making FreeMiNT development much more
efficient.

CVS, a freely available source control system, helped a lot in
achieving this goal. It handles a unique source base
(the CVS master tree) and records every change with the exact date,
the author and a changelog message. For that to work I had to
restructure the kernel source, the modules, and the tools into one
source hierarchy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Here now a short summary which parts of the source tree apply
to which copyright terms.

Please look at the header of the files for exact information!
Files that fall under the GPL are marked with `COPYING.GPL'.
