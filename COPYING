COPYING CONDITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a little complicated. First of all, I hope all things are handled
correctly. I don't want to bother anyone and I don't want to break any
copyright terms. If you think I made a mistake, please contact me.

The source code of the FreeMiNT CVS repository is based on several different
packages with different copying terms. I spent a lot of time lately doing the
same things on every package I updated over and over again. Furthermore, large
parts of the code were identical in some of the packages. So my main goal was
to get rid of such time consuming jobs, making FreeMiNT development much more
efficient.

CVS, a freely available source control system, helped a lot in achieving this
goal. It handles a unique source base (the CVS master tree) and records every
change with the exact date, the author and a changelog message. For that to
work I had to restructure the kernel source, the modules, and the tools into
one source hierarchy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here now a short summary which parts of the source tree apply to which
copyright terms.
