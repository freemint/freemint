-------------- old history
--------------
'Minixfs' Copyright S.N.Henson. See 'copying' file for more info.
Version 0.60.
Revision history .....
	0.0   Single-partition read-only version with no filename conversion.
	0.1   Added multi-partition support and filename conversion for TOS
	      domain ... added cache.
	0.2   Added write support 90% of TOS functions emulated. No write
	      cache yet ... and no access checking.
	0.25  Fixed m_seek bug.
	0.3   Added write cache and remaining tos functions fixed some bugs
	      when long files were read/written. Made search_dir more tos-like.
	0.31  Fixed some bugs . Made it permissible to delete an open file
	      (just like unix). Added full-disk error checks and minor code
	      tidy up.

--------------------First Release with MiNT 0.7----------------------------

	0.32  Added 'zlast' to speed up free zone searches. Also added
	      consecutive zone read/write to speed up i/o . Fixed bugs
	      all over the place with curdir .
	0.33  Fixed code for > 512 byte sectors. Merged add_zone and
	      find_zone, new code should support sparse files .
	0.34  Tentative support for floppies and removeable media . Tidied up
	      and removed redundant code (like minix_init() ) .
	0.35  Added access checking to all relevant functions.
	0.40  Added some un*x like inode related functions , fixed up m_rename
	      to be more robust (and related things in find_path). Fixed up
	      m_creat and merged zap_inode() with new function trunc_inode().
	      Not to mention fixing the occasional bug (or two).

--------------------Second Release with MiNT 0.8---------------------------

	0.41  Cleared up a few bugs, separated system and user caches.
	0.50  Changed stuff all over the place for new fs code in 0.9 and
	      addition of file sharing code, hard and symbolic links (yeah!).
	      converted to loadable filesystem.
===================All Subsequent Versions Are releases====================
	0.51  New compilation option TOS_LWR and tosify filenames from readdir
	      only if in compatability mode (and all domains).
	0.511 Nasty bug fixed in find_zone which screwed files bigger than 1Mb.
	0.52  Added V2 filesystem support. Extended RWABS now used, as required.
	      Code changed all over the place, new alerts added if some problems
	      are noticed in the filesystem.
	0.53  Added code to handle large directory entries.
	0.54  Overhaul of tosify code, translation now selectable by fscntl.
	0.541 Fixed bug which crashed v2 filesystems.
	0.55  Added ROBUST compilation option and file locking.

	0.60  Major code reorganisation, split up into separate files, fixed
	      bugs relating to large partitions (crwabs with 1K sectors and
	      unsigned types in read/write_zones instead of longs and dfree).
	      Introduced some enhancements for faster I/O, such as cache
	      guessing, pre-reading, and flushing consecutive cache entries.
	      Tosify now also drive dependent.
	pl1   Fixes to keep gcc 2.3.3 happy.
	pl2   Support for new calls/parameters in updated fs format.
	pl3   Support for larger partitions: pun_info/XHDI.
	pl4   Bugfixes for larger partitions and 0xffff inodes.
	pl5   Asynchronous update daemon, physical partition suport, dummy fses,
	      still more bugfixes for large partitions and larger pun's.
	pl6   Bugfixes: inode search (fsck) and stop compiler warnings.
	      FUTIMES/FTRUNCATE support added (untested).
	      Following are all courtesy of Andreas Schwab (thanks!):
	      Multiple opens with O_TRUNC locked up, unlinking of open files was
	      handled incorrectly, FILEPTR structures should be freed up on a
	      disk change. Various other fixes and code tidy.
	pl7   Fixes to FUTIMES/FTRUNCATE and sparse file handling (thanks again
	      Andreas!). Kludge to get ICD software working in physical mode
	      with cache on (thanks to Egbert Jan den Bussche for helping with
	      this).
	pl8   Arrgh!! ICD software uses something odd for physical mode Rwabs:
	      fixed. Fixed up FUTIME again (thanks again Andreas!). Minit fixes
	      all over the place for XHDI info (thanks Julian), foul up when
	      partition is a certain size (thanks Juergen). New protection
	      method introduced, and patches for fsck to tolerate it.
	pl9   Really add sparse file fix this time :-) Minor patches to make
	      disk I/O work with older XHDI (and print out the right info).
	      Patched up FUTIME yet again (thanks Andreas). Very tentative
	      support added for mount() and umount().
	pl10  Juergen's patch to improve sparse file efficiency and cache bug.
	      Patches from Andreas for F_SETLKW and FIONREAD. Fixed bug in fsck
	      which crashed when lots of zones out of range. Extra error info 
	      added and comparison check to minit, also tosfs recreate option.
	      Code to use addroottimeout if possible. Make fsck more tolerant
	      of Dlock and other failures. MFS_LOPEN and MFS_MKNOD added and
	      a small amount of support. Changes made to make filesystem more
	      Linux compatible. Docs rewritten.
	pl11  See docs\latest.doc
	pl12  fix: triple indirect block bug in truncate by Torsten Lang
