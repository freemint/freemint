      minix.xfs ready to install. All other tools (minit, fsck, ...) are not
      included here.


What's new?
-----------

First, a more detailed list of changes you found in Changes.

I removed completly the cache management and low level I/O interface. This is
integrated in the new kernel. This reduce also the code size (now 26 kb,
MinixFS 0.60 ~40 kb). For technical reasons I must remove (buggy) Mount/Unmount
Support.

I also added some new Dcntl's that are used by FSetter for example.

Please note that the old MinixFS use 120 kB as default cache. The default cache
of the new buffer cache management in FreeMiNT 1.15 is 100 kB. And the new global
buffer cache is also used by the new fat-fs and other xfs in the future.
