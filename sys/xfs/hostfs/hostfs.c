	 * we need to strip the FS_NOXBIT from the filesystem flags. For now
	 * every mount is half case sensitive and behaves just like mint's fatfs
	 * implementation in this sense.
	 *
	 * We would also need to allocate a duplicate copy if there are different
	 * styles of case sensitivity used in order to provide the kernel with
	 * appropriate filesystem information. Also some NF function would be needed
	 * to go though the configuration from the host side (at this point there
	 * is only the fs_drive_bits() which doesn't say much).
