# Makefile for hostfs.xfs
# 
# If you got these sources as part of STonX note:
#    - You have to copy all files of this directory into the FreeMiNT source
#      tree at "sys/xfs/hostfs". Instead of you may change top_srcdir at this
#      Makefile to "sys" directory of the MiNT source tree.
#      "make" does only work, if you do so!
#
# Note: You need a crosscompiler to make hostfs.xfs or a native m68k-atari-mint
#       gcc, make etc.
#       To use crosscompiling change the variables at CONFIGVARS.
#       To crosscompile even FreeMiNT, you may have to change CRLF at 
#       CONFIGVARS (e.g. say "CRLF = echo crlf"). There may be additional 
#       errors, because of using "flags" at some sub-Makefiles. Comment out
#       "flags"-calls at those Makefiles (resulting programms will only work
#       if you're running at least version 1.15.10 of FreeMiNT.
