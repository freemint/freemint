hostfs.xfs
==========

The xfs contains only the HOSTFS (NatFeat) driven .XFS interface
implementation stub mounted to U:\[a-z].
Later there might be some more devices so that we would only need
single FreeMiNT kernel module (hostfs.xfs).


hostfs.dos
==========

This is the MetaDOS driver that makes use of the NatFeat .XFS
interface. Basicaly it is the FreeMiNT file IO GEMDOS
implementation (FreeMiNT_CVS/sys/ dosfile.c dosdir.c)
mangled so that it compiles as a standalone binary.


Installation
------------
MetaDOS driver:
 * copy new hostfs.dos to your AUTO folder and add the entries
   into your bdconfig.sys, as follows:

   \AUTO\HOSTFS.DOS, E:E
   \AUTO\HOSTFS.DOS, F:F

   This example maps drives E: and F:.

FreeMiNT .XFS driver:
 * copy new hostfs.xfs (replace the old one) to your
   bootdrive:\MINT folder - drives are mounted automatically.


BUGS
----
hostfs.dos
 - relocatable programs crash due to a serious bug in MetaDOS. Use BetaDOS
   instead (version 3.12+ might be available at
   http://www.ettnet.se/~dlanor/main/html/ra_files.htm).

hostfs.xfs
 - the symlinks are not finished (work somehow).
 - other problems might occur as it is in the early stage of development
 - file/group owners are not mapped between atari and host in any way

Compilation
-----------
 * to compile the xfs you need the source tree of FreeMiNT (at least
   version 1.15.10b), set up so that it compiles. Point the
   FREEMINT_SRC_HOME environment variable to its home (the
   COPYING.MiNT file is there).
 * use make.sh to compile
 * the binaries are placed into the bin subfolder
