hostfs.xfs
==========

This driver uses the "HOSTFS" Native Feature to access an emulator
host OS filesystem. It requests the drive map from the emulator
and maps the drives automatically to U:\[a-z] entries.

The complete .xfs interface is implemented by the emulator, this
driver only forwards any call to the native part of it.
 
Enjoy!
