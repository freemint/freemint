
-*- ChangeLog is now automatically handled by CVS -*-

0.58
	- integrated into FreeMiNT CVS repositiory, lot of changes
	  around the Makefile system
	- corrected wrong return code ENAMETOOLONG to EBADARG in e_readdir,
	  e_wlabel, e_rlabel, e_readlink
	- unified the ALERT messages
	- changes related to sparse file handling in truncate
	  and the file read function; seek allow now the sparse feature

0.57
	- fix bug in Dcntl(V_CNTR_WP), clean flag not updated
	- added new FUTIME_UTC calls (ioctl & cntl)
	- added new stat call; support now UTC kernel mode
	  -> changed getxattr, FUTIME, datetime
	- fixed bug in ext2_new_inode; use effective uid and gid now
	- changed to new error codes (see errno.h, kernel header)
	- added new kernel.h
	- fix bug in datetime (SWAP68_W instead SWAP68_L)
	- update now atime on readdir (if allowed)
	- changed to new FILESYS struct

0.56
	- fixed bug in rmdir: eventual cached '.' and '..' entries are not removed
	- fixed possible bug in d_hash_setup: kmalloc result was not checked
	- added the drive letter to ALERTs; enhanced monitor dump [debug version]
	- support now block cache revision 2 extension in FreeMiNT 1.15.3 and later
	  -> faster truncate, freed blocks are not written back
	- updated Makefile to build two versions:
	  68020-60 optimized version -> ext2.xfs
	  68000 optimized version -> ext2_st.xfs [not ready yet]
	- added C routines for bitmap operations -> 68000 support
	- update in getxattr
	- removed old readdir, new work much better

0.55
	- fix bug in device driver; the file size is a global attribute
	  for every file descriptor [tail -f problem]
	- fix bug in readdir; sometimes an invalidated cache
	  block was accessed

0.54
	- fix another bug in rename; missing cross device rename check
	  rename is hopefully correct now :-)
	- optimized debug messages a little bit

0.53
	- fix bug in rename; missing DIR links decrement

0.52
	- readdir rewritten
	- replaced blocksize access by macros
	- optimized some time critical multiplications
	- fix bug in mkdir & symlink; already exist check was missed

0.51
	- cleanup in ext2_new_inode
	- fix bug in ext2_free_inode, cookie must be removed from cache
	  (bit already cleared errors)
	- some optimizations, cleanup in e_mkdir, e_rmdir, e_creat, e_remove
	- fix bug in e_readlink
	- added inode_cache_dump (for debug version)
	- fix bug in e_rename; missing link decrement
	  (zero dtime errors during filesystemcheck)
	- fix bugs in ext2_getblk functions
	  (unsigned <-> signed, overflow and so on)
	- optimzed getname; directory operation now in namei.c
	- some optimizations related to clean shutdown
	- change history order

0.50
	- return always EWRPRO for read-only mounted partitions
	- return always EACCDN for IMMUTABLE inodes
	- some optimizations
	- added Ext2 ioctls for special inode flags

0.49
	- added shutdown support
	  (to avoid filesystem checks on a normal shutdown)

0.48
	- added ioctl(FTRUNCATE), Dcntl(FUTIME), Dcntl(FTRUNCATE)
	- fix bug in ioctl(FUTIME) - missing SWAP68_L in time stuff

0.47
	- correct version numbers
	- fix bug in ext2_new_block

0.46
	- fix bug in getname (doesn't worked)
	- fix bug in read_super for bigger blocksizes

0.45
	- fix stupid bug in partial e_read/e_write
	- fix bug in truncate for dindirect & tindirect truncation
	- added rename

0.44
	- correct all sync and RD_ONLY stuff
	- lot of cleanup and corrections
	- added sync's for write through mode

0.43
	- fix bug in truncate
	- added datime
	- rewritten read
	- added write
	- added rel_cookie that decrease link and check for
	  busy deleted inodes
	- added FUTIME

0.42

	- added truncate
	- added readlabel
	- added writelabel
	- added hardlink

	- added mkdir

0.40
	- first alpha version; mostly a stable read only version

	  find_entry/add_entry/delete_entry

0.31
	- added inode cache
	- added directory cache
	- added inode read
