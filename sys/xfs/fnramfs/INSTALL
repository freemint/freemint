Installation is simple. Just copy 'fnramfs.xfs' into
your Multitos or MiNT folder on your boot partition.

If you have already installed ramfs.xfs then you must
delete these xfs from your Multitios or MiNT folder.

You need at least FreeMiNT 1.15.5, older kernels are not
supported.

The ramdisk installs itself as U:\ram. If you need a
drive letter for the ramdisk add the following line to
your MiNT.CNF file:

# drive r: as ramdisk
alias r: U:\ram
