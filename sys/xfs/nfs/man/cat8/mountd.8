NAME
     mountd, rpc.mountd - NFS mount request server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/etc/rpc.mountd 

DESCRIPTION
     mountd is an RPC  server  that  answers  file  system  mount
     requests.    It  reads  the  file  /etc/xtab,  described  in
     exports(5), to determine which file  systems  are  available
     for  mounting  by which machines.  It also provides informa-
     tion as to what file systems are mounted by  which  clients.
     This  information can be printed using the showmount(8) com-
     mand.

     The mountd daemon is normally invoked by rc(8).

FILES
