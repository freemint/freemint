NAME
     rmtab - remote mounted file system table

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/rmtab

DESCRIPTION
     rmtab resides in the /etc directory, and contains a table of
     filesystems  that are remotely mounted by NFS clients.  This
     file is maintained by rpc.mountd(8), the mount daemon.   The
     data in this file should only be obtained from rpc.mountd(8)
     using the MOUTPROC_DUMP remote procedure call.

     The file contains a line of information  for  each  remotely
     mounted  filesystem.   There  are  a  number of lines of the
     form:

          _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e:_f_s_n_a_m_e

     The mount daemon adds an entry for any client that  success-
     fully  executes  a mount request and deletes the appropriate
     entries for an unmount request.

     Lines beginning with a `#' are commented out.   These  lines
     are  removed  from  the  file by rpc.mountd(8) when it first
     starts up.  Stale entries may accumulate  for  clients  that
     crash without sending an unmount request.
