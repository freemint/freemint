NAME
     exports, xtab - directories to export to NFS clients

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/exports

     /etc/xtab

DESCRIPTION
     The /etc/exports file contains entries for directories  that
     can be exported to NFS clients.  This file is read automati-
     cally by the exportfs(8) command.  If you change this  file,
     you  must  run  exportfs(8)  for  the  changes to affect the
     daemon's operation.

     Only when this  file  is  present  at  boot  time  does  the
     rc.local  script execute exportfs(8) and start the NFS file-
     system daemon, nfsd(8).

     The /etc/xtab file contains entries for directories that are
     _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_l_y  exported.   This  file should only be accessed by
     programs using getexportent() (see exportent(3)).   Use  the
     -u option of exportfs to remove entries from this file.

     An entry for a directory consists of a line of the following
     form:

          _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y   -_o_p_t_i_o_n[,_o_p_t_i_o_n ]...

     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y      is the pathname of a directory (or file).

     _o_p_t_i_o_n         is one of the following:

                    ro   Export the directory read-only.  If  not
                         specified,  the  directory  is  exported
                         read-write.

                    rw=_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e_s[:_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e]...
                         Export   the   directory    read-mostly.
                         Read-mostly   means  read-only  to  most
                         machines, but read-write to those speci-
                         fied.   If  not specified, the directory
                         is exported read-write to all.

                    anon=_u_i_d
                         If a request comes from an unknown user,
                         use  _u_i_d as the effective user ID. Note:
                         root users (uid 0) are always considered
                         "unknown" by the NFS server, unless they
                         are included in the "root" option below.
                         The default value for this option is the
                         UID of the user "nobody".  If  the  user
                         "nobody"  does  not exist then the value
                         65534 is used.   Setting  the  value  of
                         "anon"   to   65535  disables  anonymous
                         access.  Note:  by  default  secure  NFS
                         accepts  insecure requests as anonymous,
                         and those wishing for extra security can
                         disable  this  feature by setting "anon"
                         to 65534.

                    root=_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e_s[:_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e]...
                         Give root access only to the root  users
                         from  a specified _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.  The default
                         is for  no  hosts  to  be  granted  root
                         access.

                    access=_c_l_i_e_n_t[:_c_l_i_e_n_t]...
                         Give mount access to each _c_l_i_e_n_t listed.
                         A  _c_l_i_e_n_t can either be a hostname, or a
                         netgroup (see netgroup(5)).  Each _c_l_i_e_n_t
                         in  the list is first checked for in the
                         /etc/hosts  database,   and   then   the
                         /etc/netgroups  database.   The  default
                         value allows any machine  to  mount  the
                         given directory.

                    secure
                         Require clients to  use  a  more  secure
                         protocol when accessing the directory.

     A `#' (pound-sign) anywhere in the file indicates a  comment
     that extends to the end of the line.

EXAMPLE
     /usr      -access=clients     # export to my clients
     /usr/local                    # export to the world
     /usr2     -access=hermes:zip:tutorial# export to only these machines
     /usr/sun  -root=hermes:zip    # give root access only to these
     /usr/new  -anon=0             # give all machines root access
     /usr/bin  -ro                 # export read-only to everyone
     /usr/stuff                    -access=zip,anon=-3,ro# several options on one line

FILES
     /etc/exports
     /etc/xtab
     /etc/hosts
     /etc/netgroup
     rc.local

     exportent(3), hosts(5), netgroup(5), exportfs(8), nfsd(8)

WARNINGS
     You cannot export either a parent directory or  a  subdirec-
     tory  of  an  exported  directory  that  is  _w_i_t_h_i_n _t_h_e _s_a_m_e
     _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m.  It would be illegal, for  instance,  to  export
     both  /usr and /usr/local if both directories resided on the
     same disk partition.
