MTAB(5)                   FILE FORMATS                    MTAB(5)



NAME
     mtab - mounted file system table

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/mtab

     #include <mntent.h>

DESCRIPTION
     mtab resides in the /etc directory, and contains a table  of
     filesystems  currently  mounted  by  the  mount(8)  command.
     umount removes entries from this file.

     The file contains a line of  information  for  each  mounted
     filesystem,   structurally  identical  to  the  contents  of
     /etc/fstab, described in fstab(5).  There are  a  number  of
     lines of the form:

          _f_s_n_a_m_e _d_i_r _t_y_p_e _o_p_t_s _f_r_e_q _p_a_s_s_n_o

     for example:

          /dev/xy0a / 4.2 rw,noquota 1 2
          samba:/usr/packages /nfs/packages nfs ro 0 0

     For now, this file contains only information about mounted 
     NFS file systems.
     The file is accessed by programs using getmntent(3), and  by
     the system administrator using a text editor.
