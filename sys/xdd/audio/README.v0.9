Modified by John Blakeley 9802 to provide more support on the Falcon.

I have changed the device definition to support the Falcon more completely.
This meant changing most of the files :-(

The Falcon now supports extra sample rates of 8195, 9834, 12292, 16390, 19668,
24585, 32780 and 49170Hz. It also supports s16 and u16 sample formats...

It is programmed to provide support for an external DAC and should play
8 track samples. This is untested as I don't have the hardware :-( ...
	...yet :-)
If anyone can test this please email me.

The usage of actrl has changed somewhat, to implement >2 channel support
for falcons:

	'actrl mono' will no longer work - use 'actrl chan 1'
	'actrl stereo' becomes 'actrl chan 2'
	'actrl chan 4' allows you to audition 4 channel samples if you
		have the necessary external hardware for your falcon! You can
		also try 6 or 8 too!
		

There is no control over the levels of bass and treble on the Falcon, as it
does not have a Microwire Interface.

A word of warning: the Falcon hardware does _not_ support the STe/TT compatible
sample rate of 6258Hz - it mutes. This is a feature, not a bug!!
