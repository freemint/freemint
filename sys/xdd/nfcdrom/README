NFCDROM.XDD
============

It should serve as an example of how to use native features in FreeMiNT
device drivers and other modules. It requires the kernel to be build
with -DARANYM (common aranym aware FreeMiNT kernel builds) to actually
work.

This implements a device /dev/nfcdrom to MiNT through which you can send
information to the ARAnyM cdrom driver.

It uses the CDROM native feature which is not part of the basic set
of features, and therefore might not be available in the emulator.

You also have to make sure that a cdrom device is correctly configured
on the emulator side.

Note that there might also be a NFCDROM.BOS file in your distribution.
This driver is a standalone MiNT device driver, while NFCDROM.BOS
is activated by MetaDOS (or a compatible extension). They should
be able to coexist.
