==============================

Feedback, bugreports, suggestions and any other constructive comment
is strongly recommended. Please send it as e-mail to me or the
MiNT mailinglist <freemint-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>.


 * 2000-05-24:	(v0.23)
 * 
 * - new: hopefully better behaviour on last close()
 *        (flush buffers, go back to carrier detection & update TS_BLIND)
 * 
 * 2000-05-16:	(v0.22)
 * 
 * - fix: removed unnecessary debug messages that are printed
 * 
 * 2000-05-14:	(v0.21)
 * 
 * - fix: corrected TS_BLIND <-> clocal handling; now hopefully correct
 * - new: bios emulation doesn't poll now, use sleep/wake mechanism
 *        like the read/write functions
 * 
 * 2000-05-12:	(v0.20)
 * 
 * - new: reworked the complete high level I/O routines;
 *        support now (hopefully) true tty functionality
 *        this include carrier handling, vmin/vtime handling,
 *        clocal settings and so on
 * - new: seperate read/write routines for HSMODEM devices;
 *        they never block
 * - fix: scc_close doesn't removed device locks
 * 


Features:
---------
- native driverrotuines for FreeMiNT, completly interrupt controlled
- minimal systemlast
- stable and constant data rates at 115200 Baud in background
- installs RSVF compatible and MiNT tty devices
- supports all filesharing and -locking mechanism
- completly supported by FreeMiNT
- no longer is HSMODEM, HSMINST or other stuff required


Installation:
-------------

1. deinstallation of HSMODEM (if installed)
   - remove/rename of all HSMODEM AUTO folder programms
   - remove/rename of hsminst.xdd/drvinmnt.xdd
   - remove/outcomment of the HSMODEM configuration (in your MiNT.CNF)
     like the following lines:
     --- cut ---
     # hsmodem config
     sln u:\dev\hsmodem2 u:\dev\modem2
     sln u:\dev\hsserial2 u:\dev\serial2
     --- cut ---

2. Remove/outcomment of all MiNT.CNF entries for your tty devices
   (if installed)
   like the following lines:
   --- cut ---
   ren u:\dev\modem2  u:\dev\ttyb
   ren u:\dev\serial1 u:\dev\ttyc
   ren u:\dev\serial2 u:\dev\ttyd
   
   sln u:\dev\ttyb u:\dev\modem2
   sln u:\dev\ttyc u:\dev\serial1
   sln u:\dev\ttyd u:\dev\serial2
   --- cut ---

3. Copy the xdd to your MultiTOS or MiNT folder on your boot device

4. Verify that you have at least FreeMiNT 1.15.6 installed
   if not the driver simply don't work

5. Reboot
