 *
 * The rendezvous:
 * a little bit of message passing with a lot of synchronization.
 *
 * Pmsg(mode,mboxid,msgptr);
 * short mode;
 * long mboxid;
 * struct { long msg1, msg2; short pid; } *msgptr;
 *
 * 'mode' bits:
 *   0000	read
 *   0001	write
 *   0002	write, then read from mboxid "PDxx" where xx is my pid.
 *
 *   8000	OR with this bit to make the operation non-blocking.
 *
 * The messages are five words long: two longs and a short, in that order.
 * The values  of the first two longs are totally up to the processes in
 * question.  The value of the short is the PID of the sender.  On return
 * from writes, the short is the PID of the process that read your message.
 * On return from reads, it's the PID of the writer.
 *
 * If the 0x8000 bit is set in the mode, and there is not a reader/writer
 * for the mboxid already on the WAIT_Q, this call returns -1.
 *
 * In mode 2, the writer is declaring that it wants to wait for a reply to
 * the message.  What happens is that the reader gets put on the ready
 * queue, but the writer is atomically turned into a reader on a mailbox
 * whose mboxid is (0xFFFF0000 .OR. pid). The idea is that this process
 * will sleep until awoken at a later time by the process that read the
 * message.  The process reading the original request is guaranteed not to
 * block when writing the reply.
 *
 * There is no provision for a timeout.

The flow is as follows:

    if (you're writing)
	if (there's somebody waiting to read)
					    (SATISFY THE RENDEZVOUS RIGHT AWAY)
	    copy msg from your data space into his proc structure
	    wake him up
	    if (you're doing a write/read)
					(TURN AROUND AND BLOCK WAITING TO READ)
		write mode 0 to your proc struct and change your mbid
		goto dosleep
	    else
		fill in his PID in your data space
		return 0;
	    endif
	else
				       (YOU HAVE TO BLOCK WAITING FOR A WRITER)
	    copy from your data space to your proc structure
	    goto dosleep
	endif
    else (you're reading)
	if (there's somebody waiting to write)
					    (SATISFY THE RENDEZVOUS RIGHT AWAY)
	    copy msg from his proc to your data space
	    if (he's doing a write/read)
					 (TURN HIM AROUND WAITING FOR A WRITER)
		change his mode from write/read to read, and his mbid
		leave him asleep
	    else
		wake him up
	    endif
	    return 0;
	else
				       (YOU HAVE TO BLOCK WAITING FOR A READER)
	    write mode 0 to your proc struct
	    goto dosleep
	endif
    endif

dosleep:
    if (non-blocking mode) return EWOULDBLOCK;
    do {
        sleep(WAIT_Q, WAIT_MB);
    } until (a rendezvous happens);
    (when you wake up...)
    if (you're reading)
	copy from your proc struct to your data space
    else
	copy the writer's PID from your proc struct to your data space
    endif
    return 0;

 * The wait_cond we use is WAIT_MB, and the mbid waited for is another
 * field in the proc structure, along with the two longs and a short you
 * need to remember what somebody else wrote to you, and the mode field for
 * what kind of operation you're doing (read, write, write/read).
 *
 * The beauty of this is that mailboxes don't need to be created or
 * destroyed, and the blocking and turnaround are atomic, and it's a way to
 * do rendezvous and interprocess communication without lots of system
 * calls (Pgetpid, Fwrite, Pause, plus synchronization worries about having
 * the reader get the message and Pkill you before you've Paused).
 *
 * Note: Say PID 33 writes in mode 2 to MBXX and it blocks. Then somebody
 * writes to PD33, and blocks because you're not waiting for it.  Then your
 * write is satisfied, so you become a reader on PD33.  We should check to
 * see if there are any writers on PD33 and satisfy that rendezvous! But
 * this could go on forever, and it's easier to stop here.  So you lose:
 * this situation is timing sensitive.  It shouldn't come up anyway.
