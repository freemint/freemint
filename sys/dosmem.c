 * If the process was killed by a signal the signal that caused the 
 * termination is put into the last seven bits. If no children exist, 
 * return "File Not Found".
 *
 * If (nohang & 1) is nonzero, then return a 0 immediately if we have
 * no dead children but some living ones that we still have to wait
 * for. If (nohang & 2) is nonzero, then we return any stopped
 * children; otherwise, only children that have exited or are stopped
 * due to a trace trap are returned.
 * If "rusage" is non-zero and a child is found, put the child's
 * resource usage into it (currently only the user and system time are
 * sent back).
 * The pid argument specifies a set of child processes for which status
 * is requested:
 * 	If pid is equal to -1, status is requested for any child process.
 *
 *	If pid is greater than zero, it specifies the process ID of a
 *	single child process for which status is requested.
 *
 *	If pid is equal to zero, status is requested for any child
 *	process whose process group ID is equal to that of the calling
 *	process.
 *
 *	If pid is less than -1, status is requested for any child process
 *	whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.
 *
 * Note this call is a real standard crosser... POSIX.1 doesn't have the
 * rusage stuff, BSD doesn't have the pid stuff; both are useful, so why
 * not have it all!
 *
 * NOTE:  There is one important difference to the standard behaviour
 *        of the waitpid function:  If WNOHANG was specified and no
 *        children were found, waitpid should actually return immediately
 *        with no error.  Instead, MiNT will return ENOENT in that
 *        case.  This is probably a bug but we won't change it now
 *        because existing binaries may expect that behavior.  A library
 *        binding should take that into account:  If WNOHANG was specified
 *        and the return value is ENOENT,  don't set errno and return
 *        zero to the process.  If you recompile your `make' program
 *        with that kludge you will never see the
 *
 *        	make: *** wait: file not found.  Stop.
