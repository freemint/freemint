/* Construct a usable argument vector and argument buffer for the
 * newborn process P.  Returns zero on success or a negative error
 * number on failure.  The only possible error condition is ENOMEM.
 *
 * The function knows about various calling conventions, notably
 * the extended ARGV technique with a possible list of NULL arguments
 * (indicated by the value "NULL:<LIST>" for the ARGV envariable)
 * and also about really obsoleted argument passing via the p_cmdlin
 * member of the basepage structure.  For such obsolete stuff it
 * even checks for the pseudo-quoting done by some buggy desktops.
 *
 * It puts the result into one single buffer inside the process
 * structure.  The layout of this buffer may look strange at first
 * glance but it is optimized for two purposes:  First, the sys
 * pseudo-filesystem can use the information to serve read requests
 * from the special file /sys/<PID>/cmdline, second, for future
 * enhancements of the MiNT kernel, the buffer can be used to
 * pass a standard argument vector to the new process (no matter
 * how this is done.
 *
 * The layout is as follows:
 *
 * 1. The first four bytes store the length of the entire buffer,
 *    including the double null-termination byte at the end.
 * 2. The number of arguments ARGC (as an unsigned long).
 * 3. A NULL-terminated array of offsets into the buffer counted
 *    from the address of this array (resp. its first member)
 *    itself.
 * 4. A null-terminated buffer with the arguments itself.  An
 *    extra null-byte is appended to the end of the buffer to
 *    denote the end of arguments.  The buffer is therefore always
 *    terminated by a double null-byte but you may also encounter
 *    two or more subsequent null-bytes in the middle of the buffer
 *    caused by empty arguments.  Use ARGC and the offsets
 *    in the ARGV vector to find the end of arguments.	Note that
 *    the special files /sys/<PID>/cmdline will NOT contains
 *    the last two null-bytes (because the end of the buffer is
 *    always terminated by EOF.
 *
 * If this argument vector and the argument buffer should be passed
 * to the process in some future MiNT version, you should proceed
 * as follows:	First negotiate the required buffer size with the
 * child process.  The required size can be found at offset 0 (i. e.
 * it denote the amount of memory the process should allocate for
 * the argument vector/buffer).  ARGC can be passed as an lvalue
 * and the rest of the kernel buffer can then be copied into the
 * user buffer.  The user program should then add the address of
 * the first argument to all non-NULL members of the ARGV array
 * and can then pass this to the main() function (note that one
 * malloc() is sufficient for that).
 *
 * The sys pseudo-filesystem has to do slightly more calculations
 * but this is still tolerable.
