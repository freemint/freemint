 * 
 * Routines to de/encrypt blocks read/written in block_IO.c. The actual
 * cryptographic code (Blowfish) is in blowfish.c.
 * 
 * History:
 * 2000-05-29: - crypt_block() now gets the physical record number, adapted
 *               calls to it accordingly (Gryf)
 *             - rwabs_crypto() didn't properly skip the bootsector (forgot to
 *               increment the record number, which is used for the feedback in
 *               CBC mode) (Gryf)
 * 2000-02-02: - Added additional parameter to d_setkey, which selects the
 *               cipher to use. Currently, only a value of zero (Blowfish) is
 *               supported, other values are reserved for future expansions
 *               (Gryf)
 * 1999-10-13: - After disabling ciphering for a drive, the used key structure
 *               is overwritten (Gryf)
 *             - Disabling ciphering only works for drives where it is active
 *               (Gryf)
 * 1999-09-29: - Removed initial password prompts and adapted to new
 *               integration into the block IO layer (Frank)
 * 1999-09-19-
 * 1999-09-27: - Creation (Gryf)
