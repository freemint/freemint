Printer Driver for TOS, MagiC & MiNT
Developed by Claude Labelle - Licensed under GPL

This driver intercepts the parallel port while a USB printer is connected.
Applications can print normally, with or without a GDOS (NVDI 5 tested). 
Always send a form feed if the application have that option.

A printer with PCL5 (monochrome) or PCL5c (for color) emulation is 
recommended. PCL5e (monochrome) should work. PCL3GUI do not work.

For a color printer, in NVDI, select printer "HP Deskjet 500/510/520" and set 
the colors to 16,7 millions. For a monochrome printer, or to print black only 
in 600 dpi on a color printer, select "HP Laserjet 6L". In ImageCopy, select 
"BIOS" for output and "CMY colour" for color or "monochrome" for monochrome.

Color printing may not work correctly on all PCL5c printers, using the NVDI
driver. It worked fine on the Xerox Phaser 6022 tested.

The speed should be about the same than a parallel printer or faster due to a
faster printer.

It is recommended to increase the job timeout to one minute, if that option is
available on your printer. This is in case the processing of a page takes a 
long time on the computer.

This driver is to be considered a beta version. It has been tested on TOS, 
MagiC and MiNT, on TT, Falcon 030, Falcon CT63. It should work on ST. The 
only problem found was on Falcon CT63, one one user, Papyrus under TOS had 
problems, while on another, it was fine but it had problems under MagiC.
