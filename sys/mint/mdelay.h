/*
 * Using udelay() for intervals greater than a few milliseconds can
 * risk overflow for high loops_per_sec (high bogomips) machines. The
 * mdelay() provides a wrapper to prevent this.  For delays greater
 * than MAX_UDELAY_MS milliseconds, the wrapper is used.  Architecture
 * specific values can be defined in asm-???/delay.h as an override.
 * The 2nd mdelay() definition ensures GCC will optimize away the 
 * while loop for the common cases where n <= MAX_UDELAY_MS  --  Paul G.
