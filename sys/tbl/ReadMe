To enable the keyboard translation you should copy the appropriate 
*.tbl file to the mint/multitos directory on your boot drive (where 
mint.cnf resides), rename it there to keyboard.tbl, and reboot.

The *.tbl files in source forms are distributed along with the mktbl
program in the directory freemint/tools.
