/*
 * NAME
 *      ptrace - process tracing and debugging
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      #include <sys/types.h>
 *      #include <sys/ptrace.h>
 *
 *      int
 *      ptrace(int request, pid_t pid, caddr_t addr, int data);
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      ptrace() provides tracing and debugging facilities.  It allows one pro-
 *      cess (the tracing process) to control another (the traced process).  Most
 *      of the time, the traced process runs normally, but when it receives a
 *      signal (see sigaction(2)), it stops.  The tracing process is expected to
 *      notice this via wait(2) or the delivery of a SIGCHLD signal, examine the
 *      state of the stopped process, and cause it to terminate or continue as
 *      appropriate.  ptrace() is the mechanism by which all this happens.
 *
 *      The request argument specifies what operation is being performed; the
 *      meaning of the rest of the arguments depends on the operation, but except
 *      for one special case noted below, all ptrace() calls are made by the
 *      tracing process, and the pid argument specifies the process ID of the
 *      traced process.  request can be:
 *
 *      PT_TRACE_ME   This request is the only one used by the traced process; it
 *                    declares that the process expects to be traced by its par-
 *                    ent.  All the other arguments are ignored.  (If the parent
 *                    process does not expect to trace the child, it will proba-
 *                    bly be rather confused by the results; once the traced pro-
 *                    cess stops, it cannot be made to continue except via
 *                    ptrace().)  When a process has used this request and calls
 *                    execve(2) or any of the routines built on it (such as
 *                    execv(3)), it will stop before executing the first instruc-
 *                    tion of the new image.  Also, any setuid or setgid bits on
 *                    the executable being executed will be ignored.
 *
 *      PT_READ_I, PT_READ_D
 *                    These requests read a single int of data from the traced
 *                    process' address space.  Traditionally, ptrace() has al-
 *                    lowed for machines with distinct address spaces for in-
 *                    struction and data, which is why there are two requests:
 *                    conceptually, PT_READ_I reads from the instruction space
 *                    and PT_READ_D reads from the data space.  In the current
 *                    NetBSD implementation, these two requests are completely
 *                    identical.  The addr argument specifies the address (in the
 *                    traced process' virtual address space) at which the read is
 *                    to be done.  This address does not have to meet any align-
 *                    ment constraints.  The value read is returned as the return
 *                    value from ptrace().
 *
 *      PT_WRITE_I, PT_WRITE_D
 *                    These requests parallel PT_READ_I and PT_READ_D, except
 *                    that they write rather than read.  The data argument sup-
 *                    plies the value to be written.
 *
 *      PT_CONTINUE   The traced process continues execution.  addr is an address
 *                    specifying the place where execution is to be resumed (a
 *                    new value for the program counter), or (caddr_t)1 to indi-
 *                    cate that execution is to pick up where it left off.  data
 *                    provides a signal number to be delivered to the traced pro-
 *                    cess as it resumes execution, or 0 if no signal is to be
 *                    sent.
 *
 *      PT_KILL       The traced process terminates, as if PT_CONTINUE had been
 *                    used with SIGKILL given as the signal to be delivered.
 *
 *      PT_ATTACH     This request allows a process to gain control of an other-
 *                    wise unrelated process and begin tracing it.  It does not
 *                    need any cooperation from the to-be-traced process.  In
 *                    this case, pid specifies the process ID of the to-be-traced
 *                    process, and the other two arguments are ignored.  This re-
 *                    quest requires that the target process must have the same
 *                    real UID as the tracing process, and that it must not be
 *                    executing a setuid or setgid executable.  (If the tracing
 *                    process is running as root, these restrictions do not ap-
 *                    ply.)  The tracing process will see the newly-traced pro-
 *                    cess stop and may then control it as if it had been traced
 *                    all along.
 *
 *                    Two other restrictions apply to all tracing processes, even
 *                    those running as root.  First, no process may trace the
 *                    process running init(8).  Second, if a process has its root
 *                    directory set with chroot(2), it may not trace another pro-
 *                    cess unless that process's root directory is at or below
 *                    the tracing process's root.
 *
 *      PT_DETACH     This request is like PT_CONTINUE, except that it does not
 *                    allow specifying an alternative place to continue execu-
 *                    tion, and after it succeeds, the traced process is no
 *                    longer traced and continues execution normally.
 *
 *      Additionally, machine-specific requests can exist.  On the SPARC, these
 *      are:
 *
 *      PT_GETREGS    This request reads the traced process' machine registers
 *                    into the ``struct reg'' (defined in <machine/reg.h>) point-
 *                    ed to by addr.
 *
 *      PT_SETREGS    This request is the converse of PT_GETREGS; it loads the
 *                    traced process' machine registers from the ``struct reg''
 *                    (defined in <machine/reg.h>) pointed to by addr.
 *
 *      PT_GETFPREGS  This request reads the traced process' floating-point reg-
 *                    isters into the ``struct fpreg'' (defined in
 *                    <machine/reg.h>) pointed to by addr.
 *
 *      PT_SETFPREGS  This request is the converse of PT_GETFPREGS; it loads the
 *                    traced process' floating-point registers from the ``struct
 *                    fpreg'' (defined in <machine/reg.h>) pointed to by addr.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *      Some requests can cause ptrace() to return -1 as a non-error value; to
 *      disambiguate, errno can be set to 0 before the call and checked after-
 *      wards.  The possible errors are:
 *
 *      [ESRCH]
 *            No process having the specified process ID exists.
 *
 *      [EINVAL]
 *            o   A process attempted to use PT_ATTACH on itself.
 *            o   The request was not one of the legal requests.
 *            o   The signal number (in data) to PT_CONTINUE was neither 0 nor a
 *                legal signal number.
 *            o   PT_GETREGS, PT_SETREGS, PT_GETFPREGS, or PT_SETFPREGS was at-
 *                tempted on a process with no valid register set.  (This is nor-
 *                mally true only of system processes.)
 *
 *      [EBUSY]
 *            o   PT_ATTACH was attempted on a process that was already being
 *                traced.
 *            o   A request attempted to manipulate a process that was being
 *                traced by some process other than the one making the request.
 *            o   A request (other than PT_ATTACH) specified a process that
 *                wasn't stopped.
 *
 *      [EPERM]
 *            o   A request (other than PT_ATTACH) attempted to manipulate a pro-
 *                cess that wasn't being traced at all.
 *            o   An attempt was made to use PT_ATTACH on a process in violation
 *                of the requirements listed under PT_ATTACH above.
