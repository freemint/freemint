 *
 * Currently only bit 0 of `flags' is used. Meaning:
 * Bit 0 set: Call from interrupt (cannot use kmalloc, use statically

 * Bit 0 clear: Not called from interrupt, can use kmalloc.

 * Thus addroottimeout() can be called from interrupts (bit 0 of flags set),
 * which makes it *extremly* useful for device drivers.
 * A serial device driver would make an addroottimeout(0, check_keys, 1)
 * if some bytes have arrived.
 * check_keys() is then called at the next context switch, can use all
 * the kernel functions and can do time cosuming jobs.
