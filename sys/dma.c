 * 
 * 
 * known bugs:
 * 
 * - nothing
 * 
 * todo:
 * 
 * 
 * explanation:
 * 
 * - every DMA driver first registers with the kernel. The kernel allocates a
 *   unique channel descriptor for the driver which is then used for further
 *   function calls.
 *   
 *   for registration the driver must use get_channel; get_channel return then
 *   an unique channel number; a return value of 0 indicate that there are no
 *   free channel available; any other value indicate a valid channel
 * 
 * - A DMA driver can unregister (if it wants to terminate).
 *   
 *   for unregistration the driver must use free_channel; free_channel return
 *   -1 for a channel that was not allocated; in general, this is mostly
 *   a FATAL error and the driver must halt the system after he printed
 *   some information message
 * 
 * - When entering the driver, the driver calls dma_start. The kernel
 *   automatically sets a semaphore for the driver and blocks here if another
 *   process is already using the driver.
 * 
 * - Then the driver can do whatever is necessary to start operation and
 *   enable an interrupt. When this is done, the driver calls
 *   dma_block(channel) which will block the current process and give up the
 *   processor.
 *   
 *   dma_block can also automatically handle timeout events. For this dma_block
 *   get an timeout value. The value specifiy the time in milliseconds.
 *   If the timeout expire it will call the function that is the third argument
 *   to dma_block or a default timeout function if the third argument is NULL.
 *   The default timeout function simply call deblock(channel, -2) to unblock
 *   the process. The return value of dma_block is then -2 if the timeout
 *   deblock the process.
 *   If you doesn't need a timeout simply set all other arguments of dma_block
 *   to 0. A value of 0 for the timeout means an infinite timeout that
 *   effectivly disable this feature.
 *   
 *   Note: It's not granted that the timeout happen *exactly* after the
 *         specified number of milliseconds.
 * 
 * - Now another process can run; if this process also tries to access the
 *   driver, it will automatically be blocked because the semaphore is locked.
 * 
 * - When the device has finished its operation, it causes an interrupt which
 *   calls the ISR in the driver. The driver can either restart the device (if
 *   further processing is required for the current task, eg. when doing
 *   scatter-gather DMA), *or* it can call dma_deblock(channel). In either
 *   case, the ISR ends and control returns to the process that was running
 *   when the interrupt happened.  A call to dma_deblock(channel) unblocks the
 *   driver task. The kernel then switches back to the driver task, which
 *   continues by returning from dma_block. The driver may now either restart
 *   the device (using operations that take too long to do this in the ISR, or
 *   that need kernel calls) and call dma_block again, or it finishes by
 *   cleaning up and calling dma_end.
 *   
 *   Note: After dma_start the interrupt can happen at any time and call
 *         dma_deblock. The dma_block/dma_deblock interaction is interrupt
 *         safe and dma_block will not block in such case and return
 *         immediate.
 *   
 *   Note: dma_deblock get an additional parameter, called idev, 32bit long;
 *         this is simply and internal driver value that is returned unchanged
 *         from dma_block as return value
 *         if your driver doesn't need an additional value simply set it to 0;
 *         dma_block return then 0
 * 
 * - When leaving the driver, the driver calls dma_end. This resets the
 *   semaphore and unblocks other processes (one at a time) waiting to enter
 *   the driver.
 * 
 * - dma_deblock is the only routine that may be called from within an
 *   interrupt service routine.
