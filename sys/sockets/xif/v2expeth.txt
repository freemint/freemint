This driver is for the ENC28J60 modules, available on ebay at the time of
this writing for about $3.  This is an all in one SPI ethernet module.

SPI: SPI on the vampire shares a single data register between read and write.  
In order to clock out a write you have to read the data register.  So you will
see various instances of "waitdata" with the results otherwise unused.

The ENC28J60 has 4 register banks. You have to use the SetBank writes to change
which bank you want to access.  The ECON, EIR and a few other registers are
available in all banks.

You can read or write from registers or buffer memory.  The phy registers require
special handling.  The MAC and MII registers require the dummy read you'll see.

Remaining issues:
* Slow.. but it's slow on the Amiga version too.  ~170KB/sec.  It's slower in
  AmigaOS ;)
* If you set the SPI speed too fast (and sometimes even without) there is a 
  timing issue of some sort. This manifests itself in an ssh to the machine 
  or from the machine hanging right after key negotiation.  Problem in timing,
  frame lengths, reset code?  Not sure.  For me it boots and works 98% of the
  time.  If you have an issue, just restart.  Once it's working it seems to stay
  working for me.  (note this may already be corrected)
* Timing.  CIA read delay is how delays were done on the amiga.  I'm not sure
  what the "right way" is for this.  Timing code across the board can probably 
  be cleaned up.  Similarly we probably go to high interrupt priority level 
  unnecessarily in spots.
