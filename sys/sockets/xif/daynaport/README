SCSILINK.XIF
============
This is a driver for MintNet that supports the Daynaport SCSI/Link (a
SCSI-to-Ethernet device).

Hardware installation
---------------------
1. Make sure your system is powered off.
2. Connect the Daynaport SCSI/Link into the SCSI chain of your TT or
   Falcon.  If it is physically the last device in the chain, make sure
   that termination is on (the 1-0 switch is set to 1), otherwise, make
   sure that it's off (the switch is set to 0).  Set the SCSI id (the
   rotary switch) to a value that is different from any other device in
   the chain, and different from the id of the system itself, which is
   normally 7.
3. Connect the Ethernet side of the device into your Ethernet (if you
   are using 10baseT, you will need a hub).
4. Power on all the devices in the SCSI chain, before powering on your
   system.

Software installation
---------------------
1. Make sure that you have a SCSIDRV driver on your system; recent
   versions of HDDRIVER provide this function.
2. Make sure that arbitration is enabled for the SCSIDRV driver, and
   that the id of the SCSI/Link device is being controlled by SCSIDRV.
3. Copy SCSILINK.XIF to the same folder as your other XIF files; with
   a current MiNT distribution, that's MINT/1-16-CUR.
4. Update the various configuration files:
      /etc/sysconfig/config.if
      /etc/sysconfig/domainname
      /etc/sysconfig/hostname
      /etc/sysconfig/defaultroute
      /etc/resolv.conf
   Marc-Anton Kehr's e-nick program is a convenient way to do this.
   Many thanks to Marc-Anton for this and his wonderful EasyMiNT
   distribution!
5. Reboot MiNT.  You should see two 'sign-on' messages from the driver
   during initialisation; they should look something like this:
      DaynaPORT SCSI/Link driver v0.60 initialising ...
      DaynaPORT SCSI/Link driver v0.60 (en0) (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) on bus id 1/4


PERFORMANCE
===========
Performance was measured by using FTP to transfer a large (~10MB) file
between a TT and a Windoze box.  The following rates were obtained:
a) FTP server on Windoze, client on TT
   PC->TT     130 KB/sec
   TT->PC     153 KB/sec
b) FTP server on TT, client on Windoze
   PC->TT     107 KB/sec
   TT->PC     142 KB/sec
Transfers *to* the TT are expected to be slower than transfers from it,
since the TT has to poll the SCSI/Link hardware for an incoming packet,
rather than handle an interrupt.  Polling is currently triggered via 
the VBL interrupt; triggering from the system timer interrupt would
improve performance at a cost of increased overhead.


REVISION HISTORY
================
Version
-------
  0.50        First public beta release

  0.60      . Fix problem with ARP when using Daynaport firmware v1.4a


NOTES
=====
1. Testing to date has been on a TT running TOS 3.06, with the SCSI/Link
   connected to the SCSI port; however, it should also work on the ACSI
   port (see below), and on other TOS-compatible systems including the
   Falcon.  Please let me know if you have had success or problems under
   other configurations.

2. If you wish to use the ACSI port of an ST, Mega, or TT, you will
   need (at least) a host adapter that supports SCSI arbitration, i.e.
   a Link96/Link97.  You will also need a device on that port which
   provides TERMPWR to power the Link9x (the SCSI/Link does not).

3. SCSILINK.XIF is written to support multiple devices (ethernet ports),
   but that feature has not yet been tested.  If you connect two devices
   to the same Atari system and it works, please let me know!
