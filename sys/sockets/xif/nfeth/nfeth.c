/*
 * This routine is responsible for enqueing a packet for later sending.
 * The packet it passed in `buf', the destination hardware address and
 * length in `hwaddr' and `hwlen' and the type of the packet is passed
 * in `pktype'.
 *
 * `hwaddr' is guaranteed to be of type nif->hwtype and `hwlen' is
 * garuanteed to be equal to nif->hwlocal.len.
 *
 * `pktype' is currently one of (definitions in if.h):
 *	PKTYPE_IP for IP packets,
 *	PKTYPE_ARP for ARP packets,
 *	PKTYPE_RARP for reverse ARP packets.
 *
 * These constants are equal to the ethernet protocol types, ie. an
 * Ethernet driver may use them directly without prior conversion to
 * write them into the `proto' field of the ethernet header.
 *
 * If the hardware is currently busy, then you can use the interface
 * output queue (nif->snd) to store the packet for later transmission:
 *	if_enqueue (&nif->snd, buf, buf->info).
 *
 * `buf->info' specifies the packet's delivering priority. if_enqueue()
 * uses it to do some priority queuing on the packets, ie. if you enqueue
 * a high priority packet it may jump over some lower priority packets
 * that were already in the queue (ie that is *no* FIFO queue).
 *
 * You can dequeue a packet later by doing:
 *	buf = if_dequeue (&nif->snd);
 *
 * This will return NULL is no more packets are left in the queue.
 *
 * The buffer handling uses the structure BUF that is defined in buf.h.
 * Basically a BUF looks like this:
 *
 * typedef struct {
 *	long buflen;
 *	char *dstart;
 *	char *dend;
 *	...
 *	char data[0];
 * } BUF;
 *
 * The structure consists of BUF.buflen bytes. Up until BUF.data there are
 * some header fields as shown above. Beginning at BUF.data there are
 * BUF.buflen - sizeof (BUF) bytes (called userspace) used for storing the
 * packet.
 *
 * BUF.dstart must always point to the first byte of the packet contained
 * within the BUF, BUF.dend points to the first byte after the packet.
 *
 * BUF.dstart should be word aligned if you pass the BUF to any MintNet
 * functions! (except for the buf_* functions itself).
 *
 * BUF's are allocated by
 *	nbuf = buf_alloc (space, reserve, mode);
 *
 * where `space' is the size of the userspace of the BUF you need, `reserve'
 * is used to set BUF.dstart = BUF.dend = BUF.data + `reserve' and mode is
 * one of
 *	BUF_NORMAL for calls from kernel space,
 *	BUF_ATOMIC for calls from interrupt handlers.
 *
 * buf_alloc() returns NULL on failure.
 *
 * Usually you need to pre- or postpend some headers to the packet contained
 * in the passed BUF. To make sure there is enough space in the BUF for this
 * use
 *	nbuf = buf_reserve (obuf, reserve, where);
 *
 * where `obuf' is the BUF where you want to reserve some space, `reserve'
 * is the amount of space to reserve and `where' is one of
 *	BUF_RESERVE_START for reserving space before BUF.dstart
 *	BUF_RESERVE_END for reserving space after BUF.dend
 *
 * Note that buf_reserve() returns pointer to a new buffer `nbuf' (possibly
 * != obuf) that is a clone of `obuf' with enough space allocated. `obuf'
 * is no longer existant afterwards.
 *
 * However, if buf_reserve() returns NULL for failure then `obuf' is
 * untouched.
 *
 * buf_reserve() does not modify the BUF.dstart or BUF.dend pointers, it
 * only makes sure you have the space to do so.
 *
 * In the worst case (if the BUF is to small), buf_reserve() allocates a new
 * BUF and copies the old one to the new one (this is when `nbuf' != `obuf').
 *
 * To avoid this you should reserve enough space when calling buf_alloc(), so
 * buf_reserve() does not need to copy. This is what MintNet does with the BUFs
 * passed to the output function, so that copying is never needed. You should
 * do the same for input BUFs, ie allocate the packet as eg.
 *	buf = buf_alloc (nif->mtu+sizeof (eth_hdr)+100, 50, BUF_ATOMIC);
 *
 * Then up to nif->mtu plus the length of the ethernet header bytes long
 * frames may ne received and there are still 50 bytes after and before
 * the packet.
 *
 * If you have sent the contents of the BUF you should free it by calling
 *	buf_deref (`buf', `mode');
 *
 * where `buf' should be freed and `mode' is one of the modes described for
 * buf_alloc().
 *
 * Functions that can be called from interrupt:
 *	buf_alloc (..., ..., BUF_ATOMIC);
 *	buf_deref (..., BUF_ATOMIC);
 *	if_enqueue ();
 *	if_dequeue ();
 *	if_input ();
 *	eth_remove_hdr ();
 *	addroottimeout (..., ..., 1);
