Important todos for 1.16 release:
---------------------------------
If something is missing just add it; freestyle text!

kernel
- test and bugfix slip.xif (sld, ppp)
- bugfix rtl8012 driver
- BIOS remapping for lp.xdd (like it's done for the serial xdd)

tools
- release toswin 2.7 or stay with the old version???
  2.7 have some advantages but also some bugs; and nobody
  seems to fix it in the near future
- build and check fsetter, toswin against new gemlib

- would be very nice if the gem tools from draco can be integrated
  (I have the source, but all these things require his gemma slb
   lib; this won't work at all under memory protection and the
   gemma lib in cvs is still out of sync (not updated from draco))
  I like much more if these small tools can be depend only on the gemlib
  someone volunter? it shouldn't be very hard
  -> GEM gui for mkfatfs
  -> crypt (passwort set for crypted partitions, should go into fsetter)
  -> shutdown tool
  -> cache setter
  and they should work under XaAES :-)

xaaes

- add missing example configuration
