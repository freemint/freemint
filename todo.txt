Important todos for 1.16 release:
---------------------------------
If something is missing just add it; freestyle text!

kernel
- test and bugfix slip.xif (sld, ppp)
- bugfix rtl8012 driver

this is the "rather must" kernel-stuff:
- finish and implement the new syscall stuff.
- finish the keyboard handler

this is the "not must" kernel-stuff:
- libkern struct for XDD/XFS modules (a jumptable to libkern functions
  linked with the kernel, purpose: prevent libkern functions to be
  present in memory in many copies (esp. strcpy() and such stuff).
  Adams idea btw.
- make kernel TEXT+DATA+BSS supervisor protected
- make ROM and hardware registers supervisor protected, currently
  IDE I/O registers are *freely* available in user mode, at least
  on Falcons :/
- add instruction emulation for 060.

tools
- release toswin 2.7 or stay with the old version???
  2.7 have some advantages but also some bugs; and nobody
  seems to fix it in the near future
- build and check fsetter, toswin against new gemlib

- would be very nice if the gem tools from draco can be integrated
  (I have the source, but all these things require his gemma slb
   lib).
  I like much more if these small tools can be depend only on the gemlib
  someone volunter? it shouldn't be very hard.
  -> GEM gui for mkfatfs
  -> crypt (password set for crypted partitions, should go into fsetter)
  -> shutdown tool
  -> cache setter
  and they should work under XaAES :-)

xaaes
- prepare for 0.971 release?
- add missing example configuration

docu
- overview of the internal changes
- socket changes:
  - new xdd name
  - new syscalls
- new startup features
  - autoload
  - builtin shell
- new configuration stuff:
  - loadable keyboard tables
  - loadable unicode translation tables
  - mint.ini
- OLDTOSFS not supported anymore (metados never work)
- xdds integrated (audio, dsp, lp, whlmoose)
- also invent some sane format for the documentation
  (STG? info? HTML?) and convert everything into it.

general
- create rpm spec files
- build and test; checkup with Easymint
